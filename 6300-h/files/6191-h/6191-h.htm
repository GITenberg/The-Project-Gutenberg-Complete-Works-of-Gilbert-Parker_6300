    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      This book, Northern Lights, belongs to an epoch which is a generation
      later than that in which Pierre and His People moved. The conditions under
      which Pierre and Shon McGann lived practically ended with the advent of
      the railway. From that time forwards, with the rise of towns and cities
      accompanied by an amazing growth of emigration, the whole life lost much
      of that character of isolation and pathetic loneliness which marked the
      days of Pierre. When, in 1905, I visited the Far West again after many
      years, and saw the strange new life with its modern episode, energy, and
      push, and realised that even the characteristics which marked the period
      just before the advent, and just after the advent, of the railway were
      disappearing, I determined to write a series of stories which would catch
      the fleeting characteristics and hold something of the old life, so
      adventurous, vigorous, and individual, before it passed entirely and was
      forgotten. Therefore, from 1905 to 1909, I kept drawing upon all those
      experiences of others, from the true tales that had been told me, upon the
      reminiscences of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay trappers and hunters, for those incidents
      natural to the West which imagination could make true. Something of the
      old atmosphere had gone, and there was a stir and a murmur in all the West
      which broke that grim yet fascinating loneliness of the time of Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is that Northern Lights is written in a wholly different style
      from that of Pierre and His People, though here and there, as for instance
      in A Lodge in the Wilderness, Once at Red Man&rsquo;s River, The Stroke of the
      Hour, Qu&rsquo;appelle, and Marcile, the old note sounds, and something of the
      poignant mystery, solitude, and big primitive incident of the earlier
      stories appears. I believe I did well&mdash;at any rate for myself and my
      purposes&mdash;in writing this book, and thus making the human narrative
      of the Far West and North continuous from the time of the sixties onwards.
      So have I assured myself of the rightness of my intention, that I shall
      publish a novel presently which will carry on this human narrative of the
      West into still another stage-that of the present, when railways are
      intersecting each other, when mills and factories are being added to the
      great grain elevators in the West, and when hundreds and thousands of
      people every year are moving across the plains where, within my own living
      time, the buffalo ranged in their millions, and the red men, uncontrolled,
      set up their tepees.

      NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tales in this book belong to two different epochs in the life of the
      Far West. The first five are reminiscent of &ldquo;border days and deeds&rdquo;&mdash;of
      days before the great railway was built which changed a waste into a
      fertile field of civilisation. The remaining stories cover the period
      passed since the Royal North-West Mounted Police and the Pullman car first
      startled the early pioneer, and sent him into the land of the farther
      North, or drew him into the quiet circle of civic routine and humdrum
      occupation.

    <h2>
      A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hai&mdash;Yai, so bright a day, so clear!&rdquo; said Mitiahwe as she entered
      the big lodge and laid upon a wide, low couch, covered with soft skins,
      the fur of a grizzly which had fallen to her man&rsquo;s rifle. &ldquo;Hai-yai, I wish
      it would last for ever&mdash;so sweet!&rdquo; she added, smoothing the fur
      lingeringly, and showing her teeth in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will come a great storm, Mitiahwe. See, the birds go south so
      soon,&rdquo; responded a deep voice from a corner by the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Indian wife turned quickly, and, in a defiant fantastic mood&mdash;or
      was it the inward cry against an impending fate, the tragic future of
      those who will not see, because to see is to suffer?&mdash;she made some
      quaint, odd motions of the body which belonged to a mysterious dance of
      her tribe, and, with flashing eyes, challenged the comely old woman seated
      on a pile of deer-skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is morning, and the day will last for ever,&rdquo; she said nonchalantly,
      but her eyes suddenly took on a faraway look, half apprehensive, half
      wondering. The birds were indeed going south very soon, yet had there ever
      been so exquisite an autumn as this, had her man ever had so wonderful a
      trade&mdash;her man with the brown hair, blue eyes, and fair, strong face?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The birds go south, but the hunters and buffalo still go north,&rdquo; Mitiahwe
      urged searchingly, looking hard at her mother&mdash;Oanita, the Swift
      Wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dream said that the winter will be dark and lonely, that the ice will
      be thick, the snow deep, and that many hearts will be sick because of the
      black days and the hunger that sickens the heart,&rdquo; answered Swift Wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitiahwe looked into Swift Wing&rsquo;s dark eyes, and an anger came upon her.
      &ldquo;The hearts of cowards will freeze,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;and to those that will
      not see the sun the world will be dark,&rdquo; she added. Then suddenly she
      remembered to whom she was speaking, and a flood of feeling ran through
      her; for Swift Wing had cherished her like a fledgeling in the nest till
      her young white man came from &ldquo;down East.&rdquo; Her heart had leapt up at sight
      of him, and she had turned to him from all the young men of her tribe,
      waiting in a kind of mist till he, at last, had spoken to her mother, and
      then one evening, her shawl over her head, she had come along to his
      lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand times as the four years passed by she had thought how good it
      was that she had become his wife&mdash;the young white man&rsquo;s wife, rather
      than the wife of Breaking Rock, son of White Buffalo, the chief, who had
      four hundred horses, and a face that would have made winter and sour days
      for her. Now and then Breaking Rock came and stood before the lodge, a
      distance off, and stayed there hour after hour, and once or twice he came
      when her man was with her; but nothing could be done, for earth and air
      and space were common to them all, and there was no offence in Breaking
      Rock gazing at the lodge where Mitiahwe lived. Yet it seemed as though
      Breaking Rock was waiting&mdash;waiting and hoping. That was the
      impression made upon all who saw him, and even old White Buffalo, the
      chief, shook his head gloomily when he saw Breaking Rock, his son, staring
      at the big lodge which was so full of happiness, and so full also of many
      luxuries never before seen at a trading post on the Koonce River. The
      father of Mitiahwe had been chief, but because his three sons had been
      killed in battle the chieftainship had come to White Buffalo, who was of
      the same blood and family. There were those who said that Mitiahwe should
      have been chieftainess; but neither she nor her mother would ever listen
      to this, and so White Buffalo, and the tribe loved Mitiahwe because of her
      modesty and goodness. She was even more to White Buffalo than Breaking
      Rock, and he had been glad that Dingan the white man&mdash;Long Hand he
      was called&mdash;had taken Mitiahwe for his woman. Yet behind this
      gladness of White Buffalo, and that of Swift Wing, and behind the silent
      watchfulness of Breaking Rock, there was a thought which must ever come
      when a white man mates with an Indian maid, without priest or preacher, or
      writing, or book, or bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet four years had gone; and all the tribe, and all who came and went,
      half-breeds, traders, and other tribes, remarked how happy was the white
      man with his Indian wife. They never saw anything but light in the eyes of
      Mitiahwe, nor did the old women of the tribe who scanned her face as she
      came and went, and watched and waited too for what never came&mdash;not
      even after four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitiahwe had been so happy that she had not really missed what never came;
      though the desire to have something in her arms which was part of them
      both had flushed up in her veins at times, and made her restless till her
      man had come home again. Then she had forgotten the unseen for the seen,
      and was happy that they two were alone together&mdash;that was the joy of
      it all, so much alone together; for Swift Wing did not live with them,
      and, like Breaking Rock, she watched her daughter&rsquo;s life, standing afar
      off, since it was the unwritten law of the tribe that the wife&rsquo;s mother
      must not cross the path or enter the home of her daughter&rsquo;s husband. But
      at last Dingan had broken through this custom, and insisted that Swift
      Wing should be with her daughter when he was away from home, as now on
      this wonderful autumn morning, when Mitiahwe had been singing to the Sun,
      to which she prayed for her man and for everlasting days with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken angrily but now, because her soul sharply resented the
      challenge to her happiness which her mother had been making. It was her
      own eyes that refused to see the cloud, which the sage and bereaved woman
      had seen and conveyed in images and figures of speech natural to the
      Indian mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hai-yai,&rdquo; she said now, with a strange touching sigh breathing in the
      words, &ldquo;you are right, my mother, and a dream is a dream; also, if it be
      dreamt three times, then is it to be followed, and it is true. You have
      lived long, and your dreams are of the Sun and the Spirit.&rdquo; She shook a
      little as she laid her hand on a buckskin coat of her man hanging by the
      lodge-door; then she steadied herself again, and gazed earnestly into her
      mother&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Have all your dreams come true, my mother?&rdquo; she asked with
      a hungering heart. &ldquo;There was the dream that came out of the dark five
      times, when your father went against the Crees, and was wounded, and
      crawled away into the hills, and all our warriors fled&mdash;they were but
      a handful, and the Crees like a young forest in number! I went with my
      dream, and found him after many days, and it was after that you were born,
      my youngest and my last. There was also&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes almost closed, and
      the needle and thread she held lay still in her lap&mdash;&ldquo;when two of
      your brothers were killed in the drive of the buffalo. Did I not see it
      all in my dream, and follow after them to take them to my heart? And when
      your sister was carried off, was it not my dream which saw the trail, so
      that we brought her back again to die in peace, her eyes seeing the Lodge
      whither she was going, open to her, and the Sun, the Father, giving her
      light and promise&mdash;for she had wounded herself to die that the thief
      who stole her should leave her to herself. Behold, my daughter, these
      dreams have I had, and others; and I have lived long and have seen the
      bright day break into storm, and the herds flee into the far hills where
      none could follow, and hunger come, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hai-yo, see, the birds flying south,&rdquo; said the girl with a gesture
      towards the cloudless sky. &ldquo;Never since I lived have they gone south so
      soon.&rdquo; Again she shuddered slightly, then she spoke slowly: &ldquo;I also have
      dreamed, and I will follow my dream. I dreamed&rdquo;&mdash;she knelt down
      beside her mother, and rested her hands in her mother&rsquo;s lap&mdash;&ldquo;I
      dreamed that there was a wall of hills dark and heavy and far away, and
      that whenever my eyes looked at them they burned with tears; and yet I
      looked and looked, till my heart was like lead in my breast; and I turned
      from them to the rivers and the plains that I loved. But a voice kept
      calling to me, &lsquo;Come, come! Beyond the hills is a happy land. The trail is
      hard, and your feet will bleed, but beyond is the happy land.&rsquo; And I would
      not go for the voice that spoke, and at last there came an old man in my
      dream and spoke to me kindly, and said, &lsquo;Come with me, and I will show
      thee the way over the hills to the Lodge where thou shalt find what thou
      hast lost.&rsquo; And I said to him, &lsquo;I have lost nothing;&rsquo; and I would not go.
      Twice I dreamed this dream, and twice the old man came, and three times I
      dreamed it; and then I spoke angrily to him, as but now I did to thee; and
      behold he changed before my eyes, and I saw that he was now become&mdash;&rdquo;
       she stopped short, and buried her face in her hands for a moment, then
      recovered herself&mdash;&ldquo;Breaking Rock it was, I saw before me, and I
      cried out and fled. Then I waked with a cry, but my man was beside me, and
      his arm was round my neck; and this dream, is it not a foolish dream, my
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman sat silent, clasping the hands of her daughter firmly, and
      looking out of the wide doorway towards the trees that fringed the river;
      and presently, as she looked, her face changed and grew pinched all at
      once, and Mitiahwe, looking at her, turned a startled face towards the
      river also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breaking Rock!&rdquo; she said in alarm, and got to her feet quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking Rock stood for a moment looking towards the lodge, then came
      slowly forward to them. Never in all the four years had he approached this
      lodge of Mitiahwe, who, the daughter of a chief, should have married
      himself, the son of a chief! Slowly but with long slouching stride
      Breaking Rock came nearer. The two women watched him without speaking.
      Instinctively they knew that he brought news, that something had happened;
      yet Mitiahwe felt at her belt for what no Indian girl would be without;
      and this one was a gift from her man, on the anniversary of the day she
      first came to his lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking Rock was at the door now, his beady eyes fixed on Mitiahwe&rsquo;s, his
      figure jerked to its full height, which made him, even then, two inches
      less than Long Hand. He spoke in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last boat this year goes down the river tomorrow. Long Hand, your
      man, is going to his people. He will not come back. He has had enough of
      the Blackfoot woman. You will see him no more.&rdquo; He waved a hand to the
      sky. &ldquo;The birds are going south. A hard winter is coming quick. You will
      be alone. Breaking Rock is rich. He has five hundred horses. Your man is
      going to his own people. Let him go. He is no man. It is four years, and
      still there are but two in your lodge. How!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung on his heel with a chuckle in his throat, for he thought he had
      said a good thing, and that in truth he was worth twenty white men. His
      quick ear caught a movement behind him, however, and he saw the girl
      spring from the lodge door, something flashing from her belt. But now the
      mother&rsquo;s arms were round her, with cries of protest, and Breaking Rock,
      with another laugh, slipped away swiftly toward the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She will kill him perhaps, when she goes to
      him. She will go, but he will not stay. I have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he disappeared among the trees Mitiahwe disengaged herself from her
      mother&rsquo;s arms, went slowly back into the lodge, and sat down on the great
      couch where, for so many moons, she had lain with her man beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother watched her closely, though she moved about doing little
      things. She was trying to think what she would have done if such a thing
      had happened to her, if her man had been going to leave her. She assumed
      that Dingan would leave Mitiahwe, for he would hear the voices of his
      people calling far away, even as the red man who went East into the great
      cities heard the prairies and the mountains and the rivers and his own
      people calling, and came back, and put off the clothes of civilisation,
      and donned his buckskins again, and sat in the Medicine Man&rsquo;s tent, and
      heard the spirits speak to him through the mist and smoke of the sacred
      fire. When Swift Wing first gave her daughter to the white man she foresaw
      the danger now at hand, but this was the tribute of the lower race to the
      higher, and&mdash;who could tell! White men had left their Indian wives,
      but had come back again, and for ever renounced the life of their own
      nations, and become great chiefs, teaching useful things to their adopted
      people, bringing up their children as tribesmen&mdash;bringing up their
      children! There it was, the thing which called them back, the bright-eyed
      children with the colour of the brown prairie in their faces, and their
      brains so sharp and strong. But here was no child to call Dingan back,
      only the eloquent, brave, sweet face of Mitiahwe.... If he went! Would he
      go? Was he going? And now that Mitiahwe had been told that he would go,
      what would she do? In her belt was&mdash;but, no, that would be worse than
      all, and she would lose Mitiahwe, her last child, as she had lost so many
      others. What would she herself do if she were in Mitiahwe&rsquo;s place? Ah, she
      would make him stay somehow&mdash;by truth or by falsehood; by the
      whispered story in the long night, by her head upon his knee before the
      lodge-fire, and her eyes fixed on his, luring him, as the Dream lures the
      dreamer into the far trail, to find the Sun&rsquo;s hunting-ground where the
      plains are filled with the deer and the buffalo and the wild horse; by the
      smell of the cooking-pot and the favourite spiced drink in the morning; by
      the child that ran to him with his bow and arrows and the cry of the
      hunter&mdash;but there was no child; she had forgotten. She was always
      recalling her own happy early life with her man, and the clean-faced
      papooses that crowded round his knee&mdash;one wife and many children, and
      the old Harvester of the Years reaping them so fast, till the children
      stood up as tall as their father and chief. That was long ago, and she had
      had her share&mdash;twenty-five years of happiness; but Mitiahwe had had
      only four. She looked at Mitiahwe, standing still for a moment like one
      rapt, then suddenly she gave a little cry. Something had come into her
      mind, some solution of the problem, and she ran and stooped over the girl
      and put both hands on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitiahwe, heart&rsquo;s blood of mine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the birds go south, but they
      return. What matter if they go so soon, if they return soon. If the Sun
      wills that the winter be dark, and he sends the Coldmaker to close the
      rivers and drive the wild ones far from the arrow and the gun, yet he may
      be sorry, and send a second summer&mdash;has it not been so, and Coldmaker
      has hurried away&mdash;away! The birds go south, but they will return,
      Mitiahwe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a cry in the night while my man slept,&rdquo; Mitiahwe answered,
      looking straight before her, &ldquo;and it was like the cry of a bird-calling,
      calling, calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did not hear&mdash;he was asleep beside Mitiahwe. If he did not
      wake, surely it was good luck. Thy breath upon his face kept him sleeping.
      Surely it was good luck to Mitiahwe that he did not hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling a little now, for she had thought of a thing which would,
      perhaps, keep the man here in this lodge in the wilderness; but the time
      to speak of it was not yet. She must wait and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mitiahwe got to her feet with a spring, and a light in her eyes.
      &ldquo;Hai-yai!&rdquo; she said with plaintive smiling, ran to a corner of the lodge,
      and from a leather bag drew forth a horse-shoe and looked at it, murmuring
      to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman gazed at her wonderingly. &ldquo;What is it, Mitiahwe?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good-luck. So my man has said. It is the way of his people. It is
      put over the door, and if a dream come it is a good dream; and if a bad
      thing come, it will not enter; and if the heart prays for a thing hid from
      all the world, then it brings good-luck. Hai-yai! I will put it over the
      door, and then&mdash;&rdquo; All at once her hand dropped to her side, as though
      some terrible thought had come to her, and, sinking to the floor, she
      rocked her body backward and forward for a time, sobbing. But presently
      she got to her feet again, and, going to the door of the lodge, fastened
      the horseshoe above it with a great needle and a string of buckskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh great Sun,&rdquo; she prayed, &ldquo;have pity on me and save me! I cannot live
      alone. I am only a Blackfoot wife; I am not blood of his blood. Give, O
      great one, blood of his blood, bone of his bone, soul of his soul, that he
      will say, This is mine, body of my body, and he will hear the cry and will
      stay. O great Sun, pity me!&rdquo; The old woman&rsquo;s heart beat faster as she
      listened. The same thought was in the mind of both. If there were but a
      child, bone of his bone, then perhaps he would not go; or, if he went,
      then surely he would return, when he heard his papoose calling in the
      lodge in the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mitiahwe turned to her, a strange burning light in her eyes, Swift Wing
      said: &ldquo;It is good. The white man&rsquo;s Medicine for a white man&rsquo;s wife. But if
      there were the red man&rsquo;s Medicine too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the red man&rsquo;s Medicine?&rdquo; asked the young wife, as she smoothed
      her hair, put a string of bright beads around her neck, and wound a red
      sash round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head, a curious half-mystic light in her eyes, her
      body drawn up to its full height, as though waiting for something. &ldquo;It is
      an old Medicine. It is of winters ago as many as the hairs of the head. I
      have forgotten almost, but it was a great Medicine when there were no
      white men in the land. And so it was that to every woman&rsquo;s breast there
      hung a papoose, and every woman had her man, and the red men were like
      leaves in the forest&mdash;but it was a winter of winters ago, and the
      Medicine Men have forgotten; and thou hast no child! When Long Hand comes,
      what will Mitiahwe say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mitiahwe&rsquo;s eyes were determined, her face was set, she flushed deeply,
      then the colour fled. &ldquo;What my mother would say, I will say. Shall the
      white man&rsquo;s Medicine fail? If I wish it, then it will be so: and I will
      say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the white man&rsquo;s Medicine fail?&rdquo;&mdash;Swift Wing made a gesture
      toward the door where the horse-shoe hung. &ldquo;It is Medicine for a white
      man, will it be Medicine for an Indian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not a white man&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there were the Sun Medicine also, the Medicine of the days long
      ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me. If you remember&mdash;Kai! but you do remember&mdash;I see it in
      your face. Tell me, and I will make that Medicine also, my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, if I remember it&mdash;I will think, and if I remember it,
      to-morrow I will tell you, my heart&rsquo;s blood. Maybe my dream will come to
      me and tell me. Then, even after all these years, a papoose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the boat will go at dawn to-morrow, and if he go also&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitiahwe is young, her body is warm, her eyes are bright, the songs she
      sings, her tongue&mdash;if these keep him not, and the Voice calls him
      still to go, then still Mitiahwe shall whisper, and tell him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hai-yo-hush,&rdquo; said the girl, and trembled a little, and put both hands on
      her mother&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stood so, then with an exclamation suddenly turned and
      ran through the doorway, and sped toward the river, and into the path
      which would take her to the post, where her man traded with the Indians
      and had made much money during the past six years, so that he could have
      had a thousand horses and ten lodges like that she had just left. The
      distance between the lodge and the post was no more than a mile, but
      Mitiahwe made a detour, and approached it from behind, where she could not
      be seen. Darkness was gathering now, and she could see the glimmer of the
      light of lamps through the windows, and as the doors opened and shut. No
      one had seen her approach, and she stole through a door which was open at
      the rear of the warehousing room, and went quickly to another door leading
      into the shop. There was a crack through which she could see, and she
      could hear all that was said. As she came she had seen Indians gliding
      through the woods with their purchases, and now the shop was clearing
      fast, in response to the urging of Dingan and his partner, a Scotch
      half-breed. It was evident that Dingan was at once abstracted and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently only two visitors were left, a French halfbreed call Lablache, a
      swaggering, vicious fellow, and the captain of the steamer, Ste. Anne,
      which was to make its last trip south in the morning&mdash;even now it
      would have to break its way through the young ice. Dingan&rsquo;s partner
      dropped a bar across the door of the shop, and the four men gathered about
      the fire. For a time no one spoke. At last the captain of the Ste. Anne
      said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great chance, Dingan. You&rsquo;ll be in civilisation again, and
      in a rising town of white people&mdash;Groise &lsquo;ll be a city in five years,
      and you can grow up and grow rich with the place. The Company asked me to
      lay it all before you, and Lablache here will buy out your share of the
      business, at whatever your partner and you prove its worth. You&rsquo;re young;
      you&rsquo;ve got everything before you. You&rsquo;ve made a name out here for being
      the best trader west of the Great Lakes, and now&rsquo;s your time. It&rsquo;s none of
      my affair, of course, but I like to carry through what I&rsquo;m set to do, and
      the Company said, &lsquo;You bring Dingan back with you. The place is waiting
      for him, and it can&rsquo;t wait longer than the last boat down.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re ready
      to step in when he steps out, ain&rsquo;t you, Lablache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lablache shook back his long hair, and rolled about in his pride. &ldquo;I give
      him cash for his share to-night someone is behin&rsquo; me, share, yes! It is
      worth so much, I pay and step in&mdash;I take the place over. I take half
      the business here, and I work with Dingan&rsquo;s partner. I take your horses,
      Dingan, I take you lodge, I take all in your lodge&mdash;everyt&rsquo;ing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes glistened, and a red spot came to each cheek as he leaned
      forward. At his last word Dingan, who had been standing abstractedly
      listening, as it were, swung round on him with a muttered oath, and the
      skin of his face appeared to tighten. Watching through the crack of the
      door, Mitiahwe saw the look she knew well, though it had never been turned
      on her, and her heart beat faster. It was a look that came into Dingan&rsquo;s
      face whenever Breaking Rock crossed his path, or when one or two other
      names were mentioned in his presence, for they were names of men who had
      spoken of Mitiahwe lightly, and had attempted to be jocular about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mitiahwe looked at him, now unknown to himself, she was conscious of
      what that last word of Lablache&rsquo;s meant. Everyt&rsquo;ing meant herself.
      Lablache&mdash;who had neither the good qualities of the white man nor the
      Indian, but who had the brains of the one and the subtilty of the other,
      and whose only virtue was that he was a successful trader, though he
      looked like a mere woodsman, with rings in his ears, gaily decorated
      buckskin coat and moccasins, and a furtive smile always on his lips!
      Everyt&rsquo;ing!&mdash;Her blood ran cold at the thought of dropping the
      lodge-curtain upon this man and herself alone. For no other man than
      Dingan had her blood run faster, and he had made her life blossom. She had
      seen in many a half-breed&rsquo;s and in many an Indian&rsquo;s face the look which
      was now in that of Lablache, and her fingers gripped softly the thing in
      her belt that had flashed out on Breaking Rock such a short while ago. As
      she looked, it seemed for a moment as though Dingan would open the door
      and throw Lablache out, for in quick reflection his eyes ran from the man
      to the wooden bar across the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll talk of the shop, and the shop only, Lablache,&rdquo; Dingan said
      grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not huckstering my home, and I&rsquo;d choose the buyer if I was
      selling. My lodge ain&rsquo;t to be bought, nor anything in it&mdash;not even
      the broom to keep it clean of any half-breeds that&rsquo;d enter it without
      leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was malice in the words, but there was greater malice in the tone,
      and Lablache, who was bent on getting the business, swallowed his ugly
      wrath, and determined that, if he got the business, he would get the lodge
      also in due time; for Dingan, if he went, would not take the lodge-or the
      woman with him; and Dingan was not fool enough to stay when he could go to
      Groise to a sure fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the Ste. Anne again spoke. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing the
      Company said, Dingan. You needn&rsquo;t go to Groise, not at once. You can take
      a month and visit your folks down East, and lay in a stock of
      home-feelings before you settle down at Groise for good. They was fair
      when I put it to them that you&rsquo;d mebbe want to do that. &lsquo;You tell Dingan,&rsquo; 
      they said, &lsquo;that he can have the month glad and grateful, and a free
      ticket on the railway back and forth. He can have it at once,&rsquo; they said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching, Mitiahwe could see her man&rsquo;s face brighten, and take on a look
      of longing at this suggestion; and it seemed to her that the bird she
      heard in the night was calling in his ears now. Her eyes went blind a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game is with you, Dingan. All the cards are in your hands; you&rsquo;ll
      never get such another chance again; and you&rsquo;re only thirty,&rdquo; said the
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d ask me,&rdquo; said Dingan&rsquo;s partner with a sigh, as he looked at
      Lablache. &ldquo;I want my chance bad, though we&rsquo;ve done well here&mdash;good
      gosh, yes, all through Dingan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The winters, they go queeck in Groise,&rdquo; said Lablache. &ldquo;It is life all
      the time, trade all the time, plenty to do and see&mdash;and a bon fortune
      to make, bagosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old home was in Nove Scotia, wasn&rsquo;t it, Dingan?&rdquo; asked the captain
      in a low voice. &ldquo;I kem from Connecticut, and I was East to my village las&rsquo; 
      year. It was good seein&rsquo; all my old friends again; but I kem back content,
      I kem back full of home-feelin&rsquo;s and content. You&rsquo;ll like the trip,
      Dingan. It&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo; Dingan drew himself up with a start. &ldquo;All
      right. I guess I&rsquo;ll do it. Let&rsquo;s figure up again,&rdquo; he said to his partner
      with a reckless air.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smothered cry Mitiahwe turned and fled into the darkness, and back
      to the lodge. The lodge was empty. She threw herself upon the great couch
      in an agony of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour went by. Then she rose, and began to prepare supper. Her face
      was aflame, her manner was determined, and once or twice her hand went to
      her belt, as though to assure herself of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had the lodge looked so bright and cheerful; never had she prepared
      so appetising a supper; never had the great couch seemed so soft and rich
      with furs, so homelike and so inviting after a long day&rsquo;s work. Never had
      Mitiahwe seemed so good to look at, so graceful and alert and refined&mdash;suffering
      does its work even in the wild woods, with &ldquo;wild people.&rdquo; Never had the
      lodge such an air of welcome and peace and home as to-night; and so Dingan
      thought as he drew aside the wide curtains of deerskin and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitiahwe was bending over the fire and appeared not to hear him.
      &ldquo;Mitiahwe,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was singing to herself to an Indian air the words of a song Dingan had
      taught her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Open the door: cold is the night, and my feet are heavy,
   Heap up the fire, scatter upon it the cones and the scented leaves;
   Spread the soft robe on the couch for the chief that returns,
   Bring forth the cup of remembrance&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was like a low recitative, and it had a plaintive cadence, as of a dove
      that mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitiahwe,&rdquo; he said in a louder voice, but with a break in it too; for it
      all rushed upon him, all that she had been to him&mdash;all that had made
      the great West glow with life, made the air sweeter, the grass greener,
      the trees more companionable and human: who it was that had given the
      waste places a voice. Yet&mdash;yet, there were his own people in the
      East, there was another life waiting for him, there was the life of
      ambition and wealth, and, and home&mdash;and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were misty as she turned to him with a little cry of surprise,
      how much natural and how much assumed&mdash;for she had heard him enter&mdash;it
      would have been hard to say. She was a woman, and therefore the daughter
      of pretence even when most real. He caught her by both arms as she shyly
      but eagerly came to him. &ldquo;Good girl, good little girl,&rdquo; he said. He looked
      round him. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never seen our lodge look nicer than it does
      to-night; and the fire, and the pot on the fire, and the smell of the
      pine-cones, and the cedar-boughs, and the skins, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And everything,&rdquo; she said, with a queer little laugh, as she moved away
      again to turn the steaks on the fire. Everything! He started at the word.
      It was so strange that she should use it by accident, when but a little
      while ago he had been ready to choke the wind out of a man&rsquo;s body for
      using it concerning herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stunned him for a moment, for the West, and the life apart from the
      world of cities, had given him superstition, like that of the Indians,
      whose life he had made his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herself&mdash;to leave her here, who had been so much to him? As true as
      the sun she worshipped, her eyes had never lingered on another man since
      she came to his lodge; and, to her mind, she was as truly sacredly married
      to him as though a thousand priests had spoken, or a thousand Medicine Men
      had made their incantations. She was his woman and he was her man. As he
      chatted to her, telling her of much that he had done that day, and
      wondering how he could tell her of all he had done, he kept looking round
      the lodge, his eye resting on this or that; and everything had its own
      personal history, had become part of their lodge-life, because it had a
      use as between him and her, and not a conventional domestic place. Every
      skin, every utensil, every pitcher and bowl and pot and curtain, had been
      with them at one time or another, when it became of importance and
      renowned in the story of their days and deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he break it to her&mdash;that he was going to visit his own
      people, and that she must be alone with her mother all winter, to await
      his return in the spring? His return? As he watched her sitting beside
      him, helping him to his favourite dish, the close, companionable trust and
      gentleness of her, her exquisite cleanness and grace in his eyes, he asked
      himself if, after all, it was not true that he would return in the spring.
      The years had passed without his seriously thinking of this inevitable
      day. He had put it off and off, content to live each hour as it came and
      take no real thought for the future; and yet, behind all was the warning
      fact that he must go one day, and that Mitiahwe could not go with him. Her
      mother must have known that when she let Mitiahwe come to him. Of course;
      and, after all, she would find another mate, a better mate, one of her own
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her hand was in his now, and it was small and very warm, and suddenly
      he shook with anger at the thought of one like Breaking Rock taking her to
      his wigwam; or Lablache&mdash;this roused him to an inward fury; and
      Mitiahwe saw and guessed the struggle that was going on in him, and she
      leaned her head against his shoulder, and once she raised his hand to her
      lips, and said, &ldquo;My chief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his face cleared again, and she got him his pipe and filled it, and
      held a coal to light it; and, as the smoke curled up, and he leaned back
      contentedly for the moment, she went to the door, drew open the curtains,
      and, stepping outside, raised her eyes to the horseshoe. Then she said
      softly to the sky: &ldquo;O Sun, great Father, have pity on me, for I love him,
      and would keep him. And give me bone of his bone, and one to nurse at my
      breast that is of him. O Sun, pity me this night, and be near me when I
      speak to him, and hear what I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing out there, Mitiahwe?&rdquo; Dingan cried; and when she
      entered again he beckoned her to him. &ldquo;What was it you were saying? Who
      were you speaking to?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I heard your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thanking the Sun for his goodness to me. I was speaking for the
      thing that is in my heart, that is life of my life,&rdquo; she added vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have something to say to you, little girl,&rdquo; he said, with an
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained erect before him waiting for the blow&mdash;outwardly calm,
      inwardly crying out in pain. &ldquo;Do you think you could stand a little
      parting?&rdquo; he asked, reaching out and touching her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been alone before&mdash;for five days,&rdquo; she answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must be longer this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; she asked, with eyes fixed on his. &ldquo;If it is more than a week
      I will go too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is longer than a month,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see my people,&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Ste. Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;It is the last chance this year; but I will come back&mdash;in
      the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said it he saw her shrink, and his heart smote him. Four years such
      as few men ever spent, and all the luck had been with him, and the West
      had got into his bones! The quiet, starry nights, the wonderful days, the
      hunt, the long journeys, the life free of care, and the warm lodge; and,
      here, the great couch&mdash;ah, the cheek pressed to his, the lips that
      whispered at his ear, the smooth arm round his neck. It all rushed upon
      him now. His people? His people in the East, who had thwarted his youth,
      vexed and cramped him, saw only evil in his widening desires, and threw
      him over when he came out West&mdash;the scallywag, they called him, who
      had never wronged a man or-or a woman! Never&mdash;wronged-a-woman? The
      question sprang to his lips now. Suddenly he saw it all in a new light.
      White or brown or red, this heart and soul and body before him were all
      his, sacred to him; he was in very truth her &ldquo;Chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Untutored as she was, she read him, felt what was going on in him. She saw
      the tears spring to his eyes. Then, coming close to him she said softly,
      slowly: &ldquo;I must go with you if you go, because you must be with me when&mdash;oh,
      hai-yai, my chief, shall we go from here? Here in this lodge wilt thou be
      with thine own people&mdash;thine own, thou and I&mdash;and thine to
      come.&rdquo; The great passion in her heart made the lie seem very truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry he got to his feet, and stood staring at her for a moment,
      scarcely comprehending; then suddenly he clasped her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitiahwe&mdash;Mitiahwe, oh, my little girl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You and me&mdash;and
      our own&mdash;our own people!&rdquo; Kissing her, he drew her down beside him on
      the couch. &ldquo;Tell me again&mdash;it is so at last?&rdquo; he said, and she
      whispered in his ear once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night he said to her, &ldquo;Some day, perhaps, we will go
      East&mdash;some day, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now?&rdquo; she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now&mdash;not if I know it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my heart nailed
      to the door of this lodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he slept she got quietly out, and, going to the door of the lodge,
      reached up a hand and touched the horse-shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be good Medicine to me,&rdquo; she said. Then she prayed. &ldquo;O Sun, pity me that
      it may be as I have said to him. O pity me, great Father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the days to come Swift Wing said that it was her Medicine; when her
      hand was burned to the wrist in the dark ritual she had performed with the
      Medicine Man the night that Mitiahwe fought for her man&mdash;but Mitiahwe
      said it was her Medicine, the horse-shoe, which brought one of Dingan&rsquo;s
      own people to the lodge, a little girl with Mitiahwe&rsquo;s eyes and form and
      her father&rsquo;s face. Truth has many mysteries, and the faith of the woman
      was great; and so it was that, to the long end, Mitiahwe kept her man. But
      truly she was altogether a woman, and had good fortune.

    <h2>
      ONCE AT RED MAN&rsquo;S RIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be settled to-night, Nance. This game is up here, up for
      ever. The redcoat police from Ottawa are coming, and they&rsquo;ll soon be
      roostin&rsquo; in this post; the Injuns are goin&rsquo;, the buffaloes are most gone,
      and the fur trade&rsquo;s dead in these parts. D&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman did not answer the big, broad-shouldered man bending over her,
      but remained looking into the fire with wide, abstracted eyes and a face
      somewhat set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and your brother Bantry&rsquo;s got to go. This store ain&rsquo;t worth a cent
      now. The Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;ll come along with the redcoats, and they&rsquo;ll
      set up a nice little Sunday-school business here for what they call
      &lsquo;agricultural settlers.&rsquo; There&rsquo;ll be a railway, and the Yankees&rsquo;ll send up
      their marshals to work with the redcoats on the border, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the days of smuggling will be over,&rdquo; put in the girl in a low voice.
      &ldquo;No more bull-wackers and muleskinners &lsquo;whooping it up&rsquo;; no more Blackfeet
      and Piegans drinking alcohol and water, and cutting each others&rsquo; throats.
      A nice quiet time coming on the border, Abe, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at her queerly. She was not prone to sarcasm, she had not
      been given to sentimentalism in the past; she had taken the border-life as
      it was, had looked it straight between the eyes. She had lived up to it,
      or down to it, without any fuss, as good as any man in any phase of the
      life, and the only white woman in this whole West country. It was not in
      the words, but in the tone, that Abe Hawley found something unusual and
      defamatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, gol darn it, Nance, what&rsquo;s got into you? You bin a man out West, as
      good a pioneer as ever was on the border. But now you don&rsquo;t sound friendly
      to what&rsquo;s been the game out here, and to all of us that&rsquo;ve been risking
      our lives to get a livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; asked the girl, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t what you said, it&rsquo;s the sound o&rsquo; your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my voice, Abe. It ain&rsquo;t always the same. You ain&rsquo;t always
      about; you don&rsquo;t always hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her arm suddenly. &ldquo;No, but I want to hear it always. I want to
      be always where you are, Nance. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s got to be settled to-day&mdash;to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s got to be settled to-night!&rdquo; said the girl meditatively, kicking
      nervously at a log on the fire. &ldquo;It takes two to settle a thing like that,
      and there&rsquo;s only one says it&rsquo;s got to be settled. Maybe it takes more than
      two&mdash;or three&mdash;to settle a thing like that.&rdquo; Now she laughed
      mirthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man started, and his face flushed with anger; then he put a hand on
      himself, drew a step back, and watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can settle a thing, if there&rsquo;s a dozen in it. You see, Nance, you and
      Bantry&rsquo;s got to close out. He&rsquo;s fixing it up to-night over at Dingan&rsquo;s
      Drive, and you can&rsquo;t go it alone when you quit this place. Now, it&rsquo;s this
      way: you can go West with Bantry, or you can go North with me. Away North
      there&rsquo;s buffalo and deer, and game aplenty, up along the Saskatchewan, and
      farther up on the Peace River. It&rsquo;s going to be all right up there for
      half a lifetime, and we can have it in our own way yet. There&rsquo;ll be no
      smuggling, but there&rsquo;ll be trading, and land to get; and, mebbe, there&rsquo;d
      be no need of smuggling, for we can make it, I know how&mdash;good white
      whiskey&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll still have this free life for our own. I can&rsquo;t
      make up my mind to settle down to a clean collar and going to church on
      Sundays, and all that. And the West&rsquo;s in your bones too. You look like the
      West&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s face brightened with pleasure, and she gazed at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got its beauty and its freshness, and you got its heat and cold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw the tobacco-juice stain at the corners of his mouth, she became
      conscious of the slight odour of spirits in the air, and the light in her
      face lowered in intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got the ways of the deer in your walk, the song o&rsquo; the birds in your
      voice; and you&rsquo;re going North with me, Nance, for I bin talkin&rsquo; to you
      stiddy four years. It&rsquo;s a long time to wait on the chance, for there&rsquo;s
      always women to be got, same as others have done&mdash;men like Dingan
      with Injun girls, and men like Tobey with half-breeds. But I ain&rsquo;t bin
      lookin&rsquo; that way. I bin lookin&rsquo; only towards you.&rdquo; He laughed eagerly, and
      lifted a tin cup of whiskey standing on a table near. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; towards
      you now, Nance. Your health and mine together. It&rsquo;s got to be settled now.
      You got to go to the &lsquo;Cific Coast with Bantry, or North with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl jerked a shoulder and frowned a little. He seemed so sure of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or South with Nick Pringle, or East with someone else,&rdquo; she said
      quizzically. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always four quarters to the compass, even when Abe
      Hawley thinks he owns the world and has a mortgage on eternity. I&rsquo;m not
      going West with Bantry, but there&rsquo;s three other points that&rsquo;s open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an oath the man caught her by the shoulders, and swung her round to
      face him. He was swelling with anger. &ldquo;You&mdash;Nick Pringle, that
      trading cheat, that gambler! After four years, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go my shoulders,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your property. Go and
      get some Piegan girl to bully. Keep your hands off. I&rsquo;m not a bronco for
      you to bit and bridle. You&rsquo;ve got no rights. You&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly she
      relented, seeing the look in his face, and realising that, after all, it
      was a tribute to herself that she could keep him for four years and rouse
      him to such fury&mdash;&ldquo;but yes, Abe,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you have some rights.
      We&rsquo;ve been good friends all these years, and you&rsquo;ve been all right out
      here. You said some nice things about me just now, and I liked it, even if
      it was as if you learned it out of a book. I&rsquo;ve got no po&rsquo;try in me; I&rsquo;m
      plain homespun. I&rsquo;m a sapling, I&rsquo;m not any prairie-flower, but I like when
      I like, and I like a lot when I like. I&rsquo;m a bit of hickory, I&rsquo;m not a
      prairie-flower&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said you was a prairie-flower? Did I? Who&rsquo;s talking about
      prairie-flowers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly, turned round at the sound of a footstep behind him,
      and saw, standing in a doorway leading to another room, a man who was
      digging his knuckles into his eyes and stifling a yawn. He was a
      refined-looking stripling of not more than twenty-four, not tall, but well
      made, and with an air of breeding, intensified rather than hidden by his
      rough clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je-rick-ety! How long have I slept?&rdquo; he said, blinking at the two beside
      the fire. &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; he added, with a flutter of anxiety in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d wake you,&rdquo; said the girl, coming forwards. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have
      worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; answered the young man. &ldquo;I dreamed myself awake, I
      suppose. I got dreaming of redcoats and U. S. marshals, and an ambush in
      the Barfleur Coulee, and&mdash;&rdquo; He saw a secret, warning gesture from the
      girl, and laughed, then turned to Abe and looked him in the face. &ldquo;Oh, I
      know him! Abe Hawley&rsquo;s all O. K.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen him over at Dingan&rsquo;s
      Drive. Honour among rogues. We&rsquo;re all in it. How goes it&mdash;all right?&rdquo;
       he added carelessly to Hawley, and took a step forwards, as though to
      shake hands. Seeing the forbidding look by which he was met, however, he
      turned to the girl again, as Hawley muttered something they could not
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; answered the girl, her eyes watching his every
      movement, her face alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the moon&rsquo;s up almost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be up in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerickety! Then I&rsquo;ve got to get ready.&rdquo; He turned to the other room again
      and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;College pup!&rdquo; said Hawley under his breath savagely. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
      me he was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it any of your business, Abe?&rdquo; she rejoined quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiding him away here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiding? Who&rsquo;s been hiding him? He&rsquo;s doing what you&rsquo;ve done. He&rsquo;s
      smuggling&mdash;the last lot for the traders over by Dingan&rsquo;s Drive. He&rsquo;ll
      get it there by morning. He has as much right here as you. What&rsquo;s got into
      you, Abe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he know about the business? Why, he&rsquo;s a college man from the
      East. I&rsquo;ve heard o&rsquo; him. Ain&rsquo;t got no more sense for this life than a
      dicky-bird. White-faced college pup! What&rsquo;s he doing out here? If you&rsquo;re a
      friend o&rsquo; his, you&rsquo;d better look after him. He&rsquo;s green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going East again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if I don&rsquo;t go West with Bantry, or
      South over to Montana with Nick Pringle, or North&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes burned, his lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and wondered at the power she had over this bully of the
      border, who had his own way with most people, and was one of the most
      daring fighters, hunters, and smugglers in the country. He was cool, hard,
      and well-in-hand in his daily life, and yet, where she was concerned,
      &ldquo;went all to pieces,&rdquo; as someone else had said about himself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not without the wiles and tact of her sex. &ldquo;You go now, and come
      back, Abe,&rdquo; she said in a soft voice. &ldquo;Come back in an hour. Come back
      then, and I&rsquo;ll tell you which way I&rsquo;m going from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was all right again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s with you, Nancy,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;I bin
      waiting four years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he closed the door behind him the &ldquo;college pup&rdquo; entered the room again.
      &ldquo;Oh, Abe&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he said excitedly. &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d get rid of the old
      rip-roarer. I wanted to be alone with you for a while. I don&rsquo;t really need
      to start yet. With the full moon I can do it before daylight.&rdquo; Then, with
      quick warmth, &ldquo;Ah, Nancy, Nancy, you&rsquo;re a flower&mdash;the flower of all
      the prairies,&rdquo; he added, catching her hand and laughing into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed, and for a moment seemed almost bewildered. His boldness,
      joined to an air of insinuation and understanding, had influenced her
      greatly from the first moment they had met two months ago, as he was going
      South on his smuggling enterprise. The easy way in which he had talked to
      her, the extraordinary sense he seemed to have of what was going on in her
      mind, the confidential meaning in voice and tone and words had, somehow,
      opened up a side of her nature hitherto unexplored. She had talked with
      him freely then, for it was only when he left her that he said what he
      instinctively knew she would remember till they met again. His quick
      comments, his indirect but acute questions, his exciting and alluring
      reminiscences of the East, his subtle yet seemingly frank compliments, had
      only stimulated a new capacity in her, evoked comparisons of this
      delicate-looking, fine-faced gentleman with the men of the West by whom
      she was surrounded. But later he appeared to stumble into expressions of
      admiration for her, as though he was carried off his feet and had been
      stunned by her charm. He had done it all like a master. He had not said
      that she was beautiful&mdash;she knew she was not&mdash;but that she was
      wonderful, and fascinating, and with &ldquo;something about her&rdquo; he had never
      seen in all his life, like her own prairies, thrilling, inspiring, and
      adorable. His first look at her had seemed full of amazement. She had
      noticed that, and thought it meant only that he was surprised to find a
      white girl out here among smugglers, hunters, squaw-men, and Indians. But
      he said that the first look at her had made him feel things-feel life and
      women different from ever before; and he had never seen anyone like her,
      nor a face with so much in it. It was all very brilliantly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me want to live,&rdquo; he had said, and she, with no knowledge of the
      nuances of language, had taken it literally, and had asked him if it had
      been his wish to die; and he had responded to her mistaken interpretation
      of his meaning, saying that he had had such sorrow he had not wanted to
      live. As he said it his face looked, in truth, overcome by some deep
      inward care; so that there came a sort of feeling she had never had so far
      for any man&mdash;that he ought to have someone to look after him. This
      was the first real stirring of the maternal and protective spirit in her
      towards men, though it had shown itself amply enough regarding animals and
      birds. He had said he had not wanted to live, and yet he had come out West
      in order to try and live, to cure the trouble that had started in his
      lungs. The Eastern doctors had told him that the rough outdoor life would
      cure him, or nothing would, and he had vanished from the college walls and
      the pleasant purlieus of learning and fashion into the wilds. He had not
      lied directly to her when he said that he had had deep trouble; but he had
      given the impression that he was suffering from wrongs which had broken
      his spirit and ruined his health. Wrongs there certainly had been in his
      life, by whomever committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months ago he had left this girl with her mind full of memories of
      what he had said to her, and there was something in the sound of the
      slight cough following his farewell words which had haunted her ever
      since. Her tremendous health and energy, the fire of life burning so
      brightly in her, reached out towards this man living on so narrow a margin
      of force, with no reserve for any extra strain, with just enough for each
      day&rsquo;s use and no more. Four hours before he had come again with his team
      of four mules and an Indian youth, having covered forty miles since his
      last stage. She was at the door and saw him coming while he was yet along
      distance off. Some instinct had told her to watch that afternoon, for she
      knew of his intended return and of his dangerous enterprise. The Indians
      had trailed south and east, the traders had disappeared with them, her
      brother Bantry had gone up and over to Dingan&rsquo;s Drive, and, save for a few
      loiterers and last hangers-on, she was alone with what must soon be a
      deserted post; its walls, its great enclosed yard, and its gun-platforms
      (for it had been fortified) left for law and order to enter upon, in the
      persons of the red-coated watchmen of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the South, from over the border, bringing the last great smuggled
      load of whiskey which was to be handed over at Dingan&rsquo;s Drive, and then
      floated on Red Man&rsquo;s River to settlements up North, came the &ldquo;college
      pup,&rdquo; Kelly Lambton, worn out, dazed with fatigue, but smiling too, for a
      woman&rsquo;s face was ever a tonic to his blood since he was big enough to move
      in life for himself. It needed courage&mdash;or recklessness&mdash;to run
      the border now; for, as Abe Hawley had said, the American marshals were on
      the pounce, the red-coated mounted police were coming west from Ottawa,
      and word had winged its way along the prairie that these redcoats were
      only a few score miles away, and might be at Fort Fair Desire at any
      moment. The trail to Dingan&rsquo;s Drive lay past it. Through Barfleur Coulee,
      athwart a great open stretch of country, along a wooded belt, and then,
      suddenly, over a ridge, Dingan&rsquo;s Drive and Red Man&rsquo;s River would be
      reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government had a mind to make an example, if necessary, by killing
      some smugglers in conflict, and the United States marshals had been goaded
      by vanity and anger at one or two escapes &ldquo;to have something for their
      money,&rdquo; as they said. That, in their language, meant, &ldquo;to let the red
      run,&rdquo; and Kelly Lambton had none too much blood to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked very pale and beaten as he held Nance Machell&rsquo;s hands now, and
      called her a prairie-flower, as he had done when he left her two months
      before. On his arrival but now he had said little, for he saw that she was
      glad to see him, and he was dead for sleep, after thirty-six hours of
      ceaseless travel and watching and danger. Now, with the most perilous part
      of his journey still before him, and worn physically as he was, his blood
      was running faster as he looked into the girl&rsquo;s face, and something in her
      abundant force and bounding life drew him to her. Such vitality in a man
      like Abe Hawley would have angered him almost, as it did a little time
      ago, when Abe was there; but possessed by the girl, it roused in him a
      hunger to draw from the well of her perfect health, from the unused vigour
      of her being, something for himself. The touch of her hands warmed him, in
      the fulness of her life, in the strong eloquence of face and form, he
      forgot she was not beautiful. The lightness passed from his words, and his
      face became eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flower, yes, the flower of the life of the West&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I
      mean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are like an army marching. When I look at you, my
      blood runs faster. I want to march too. When I hold your hand I feel that
      life&rsquo;s worth living&mdash;I want to do things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand away rather awkwardly. She had not now that command of
      herself which had ever been easy with the men of the West, except,
      perhaps, with Abe Hawley when&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with an attempt, only half-meant, to turn the topic, she said: &ldquo;You
      must be starting if you want to get through to-night. If the redcoats
      catch you this side of Barfleur Coulee, or in the Coulee itself, you&rsquo;ll
      stand no chance. I heard they was only thirty miles north this afternoon.
      Maybe they&rsquo;ll come straight on here to-night, instead of camping. If they
      have news of your coming, they might. You can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He caught her hand again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be going now. But
      Nance&mdash;Nance&mdash;Nancy, I want to stay here, here with you; or to
      take you with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Take me with you&mdash;me&mdash;where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East&mdash;away down East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brain throbbed, her pulses beat so hard. She scarcely knew what to
      say, did not know what she said. &ldquo;Why do you do this kind of thing? Why do
      you smuggle?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You wasn&rsquo;t brought up to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get this load of stuff through is life and death to me,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made six thousand dollars out here. That&rsquo;s enough to start me again
      in the East, where I lost everything. But I&rsquo;ve got to have six hundred
      dollars clear for the travel&mdash;railways and things; and I&rsquo;m having
      this last run to get it. Then I&rsquo;ve finished with the West, I guess. My
      health&rsquo;s better; the lung is closed up, I&rsquo;ve only got a little cough now
      and again; and I&rsquo;m off East. I don&rsquo;t want to go alone.&rdquo; He suddenly caught
      her in his arms. &ldquo;I want you&mdash;you, to go with me, Nancy&mdash;Nance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brain swam. To leave the West behind, to go East to a new life full of
      pleasant things, as this man&rsquo;s wife! Her great heart rose, and suddenly
      the mother in her as well as the woman in her was captured by his wooing.
      She had never known what it was to be wooed like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about to answer, when there came a sharp knock at the door leading
      from the backyard, and Lambton&rsquo;s Indian lad entered. &ldquo;The soldier&mdash;he
      come&mdash;many. I go over the ridge; I see. They come quick here,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nance gave a startled cry, and Lambton turned to the other room for his
      pistols, overcoat, and cap, when there was the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs, the
      door suddenly opened, and an officer stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted for smuggling, Lambton,&rdquo; he said brusquely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir!&rdquo;
       In his hand was a revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh! Prove it,&rdquo; answered the young man, pale and startled, but cool
      in speech and action. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll prove it all right. The stuff is hereabouts.&rdquo;
       The girl said something to the officer in the Chinook language. She saw he
      did not understand. Then she spoke quickly to Lambton in the same tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep him here a bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His men haven&rsquo;t come yet. Your outfit is
      well hid. I&rsquo;ll see if I can get away with it before they find it. They&rsquo;ll
      follow, and bring you with them, that&rsquo;s sure. So if I have luck and get
      through, we&rsquo;ll meet at Dingan&rsquo;s Drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lambton&rsquo;s face brightened. He quickly gave her a few directions in
      Chinook, and told her what to do at Dingan&rsquo;s if she got there first. Then
      she was gone. The officer did not understand what Nance had said, but he
      realised that, whatever she intended to do, she had an advantage over him.
      With an unnecessary courage he had ridden on alone to make his capture,
      and, as it proved, without prudence. He had got his man, but he had not
      got the smuggled whiskey and alcohol he had come to seize. There was no
      time to be lost. The girl had gone before he realised it. What had she
      said to the prisoner? He was foolish enough to ask Lambton, and Lambton
      replied coolly: &ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d get you some supper, but she guessed it
      would have to be cold&mdash;What&rsquo;s your name? Are you a colonel, or a
      captain, or only a principal private?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Captain MacFee, Lambton. And you&rsquo;ll now bring me where your outfit
      is. March!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pistol was still in his hand, and he had a determined look in his eye.
      Lambton saw it. He was aware of how much power lay in the threatening face
      before him, and how eager that power was to make itself felt, and provide
      &ldquo;Examples&rdquo;; but he took his chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll march all right,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll march to where you tell me.
      You can&rsquo;t have it both ways. You can take me, because you&rsquo;ve found me, and
      you can take my outfit too when you&rsquo;ve found it; but I&rsquo;m not doing your
      work, not if I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a blaze of anger in the eyes of the officer, and it looked for
      an instant as though something of the lawlessness of the border was going
      to mark the first step of the Law in the Wilderness, but he bethought
      himself in time, and said quietly, yet in a voice which Lambton knew he
      must heed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on your things-quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this was accomplished, and MacFee had secured the smuggler&rsquo;s pistols,
      he said again, &ldquo;March, Lambton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lambton marched through the moonlit night towards the troop of men who had
      come to set up the flag of order in the plains and hills, and as he went
      his keen ear heard his own mules galloping away down towards the Barfleur
      Coulee. His heart thumped in his breast. This girl, this prairie-flower,
      was doing this for him, was risking her life, was breaking the law for
      him. If she got through, and handed over the whiskey to those who were
      waiting for it, and it got bundled into the boats going North before the
      redcoats reached Dingan&rsquo;s Drive, it would be as fine a performance as the
      West had ever seen; and he would be six hundred dollars to the good. He
      listened to the mules galloping, till the sounds had died into the
      distance, but he saw now that his captor had heard too, and that the
      pursuit would be desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later it began, with MacFee at the head, and a dozen troopers
      pounding behind, weary, hungry, bad-tempered, ready to exact payment for
      their hardships and discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone a dozen miles when a shouting horseman rode furiously on
      them from behind. They turned with carbines cocked, but it was Abe Hawley
      who cursed them, flung his fingers in their faces, and rode on harder and
      harder. Abe had got the news from one of Nancy&rsquo;s half-breeds, and, with
      the devil raging in his heart, had entered on the chase. His spirit was up
      against them all; against the Law represented by the troopers camped at
      Fort Fair Desire, against the troopers and their captain speeding after
      Nancy Machell&mdash;his Nonce, who was risking her life and freedom for
      the hated, pale-faced smuggler riding between the troopers; and his spirit
      was up against Nance herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nance had said to him, &ldquo;Come back in an hour,&rdquo; and he had come back to
      find her gone. She had broken her word. She had deceived him. She had
      thrown the four years of his waiting to the winds, and a savage lust was
      in his heart, which would not be appeased till he had done some evil thing
      to someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl and the Indian lad were pounding through the night with ears
      strained to listen for hoof-beats coming after, with eyes searching
      forward into the trail for swollen creeks and direful obstructions.
      Through Barfleur Coulee it was a terrible march, for there was no road,
      and again and again they were nearly overturned, while wolves hovered in
      their path, ready to reap a midnight harvest. But once in the open again,
      with the full moonlight on their trail, the girl&rsquo;s spirits rose. If she
      could do this thing for the man who had looked into her eyes as no one had
      ever done, what a finish to her days in the West! For they were finished,
      finished for ever, and she was going&mdash;she was going East; not West
      with Bantry, nor South with Nick Pringle, nor North with Abe Hawley, ah,
      Abe Hawley, he had been a good friend, he had a great heart, he was the
      best man of all the western men she had known; but another man had come
      from the East, a man who had roused something in her never felt before, a
      man who had said she was wonderful; and he needed someone to take good
      care of him, to make him love life again. Abe would have been all right if
      Lambton had never come, and she had meant to marry Abe in the end; but it
      was different now, and Abe must get over it. Yet she had told Abe to come
      back in an hour. He was sure to do it; and, when he had done it, and found
      her gone on this errand, what would he do? She knew what he would do. He
      would hurt someone. He would follow too. But at Dingan&rsquo;s Drive, if she
      reached it before the troopers and before Abe, and did the thing she had
      set out to do; and, because no whiskey could be found, Lambton must go
      free; and they all stood there together, what would be the end? Abe would
      be terrible; but she was going East, not North, and when the time came she
      would face it and put things right somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night seemed endless to her fixed and anxious eyes and mind, yet dawn
      came, and there had fallen no sound of hoof-beats on her ear. The ridge
      above Dingan&rsquo;s Drive was reached and covered, but yet there was no sign of
      her pursuers. At Red Man&rsquo;s River she delivered her load of contraband to
      the traders waiting for it, and saw it loaded into the boats and disappear
      beyond the wooded bend above Dingan&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she collapsed into the arms of her brother Bantry, and was carried,
      fainting, into Dingan&rsquo;s Lodge. A half-hour later MacFee and his troopers
      and Lambton came. MacFee grimly searched the post and the shore, but he
      saw by the looks of all that he had been foiled. He had no proof of
      anything, and Lambton must go free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fooled us,&rdquo; he said to Nance sourly, yet with a kind of admiration
      too. &ldquo;Through you they got away with it. But I wouldn&rsquo;t try it again, if I
      were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once is enough,&rdquo; answered the girl laconically, as Lambton, set free,
      caught both her hands in his and whispered in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacFee turned to the others. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better drop this kind of thing,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I mean business.&rdquo; They saw the troopers by the horses, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we was about quit of it anyhow,&rdquo; said Bantry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had all we
      want out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud laugh went up, and it was still ringing when there burst into the
      group, out of the trail, Abe Hawley, on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the group savagely till his eyes rested on Nance and
      Lambton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m last in,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;My horse broke its leg
      cutting across to get here before her&mdash;&rdquo; He waved a hand towards
      Nance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best stickin&rsquo; to old trails, not tryin&rsquo; new ones.&rdquo; His eyes
      were full of hate as he looked at Lambton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping to old trails. I&rsquo;m
      for goin&rsquo; North, far up, where these two-dollar-a-day and hash-and-clothes
      people ain&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo; He made a contemptuous gesture toward MacFee and
      his troopers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; North&mdash;&rdquo; He took a step forward and fixed
      his bloodshot eyes on Nance. &ldquo;I say I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; North. You comin&rsquo; with me,
      Nance?&rdquo; He took off his cap to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was haggard, his buckskins were torn, his hair was dishevelled, and he
      limped a little; but he was a massive and striking figure, and MacFee
      watched him closely, for there was that in his eyes which meant trouble.
      &ldquo;You said, &lsquo;Come back in an hour,&rsquo; Nance, and I come back, as I said I
      would,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t stand to your word. I&rsquo;ve come to git it.
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; North, Nance, and I bin waitin&rsquo; for four years for you to go
      with me. Are you comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was quiet, but it had a choking kind of sound, and it struck
      strangely in the ears of all. MacFee came nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you comin&rsquo; with me, Nance, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached a hand towards Lambton, and he took it, but she did not speak.
      Something in Abe&rsquo;s eyes overwhelmed her&mdash;something she had never seen
      before, and it seemed to stifle speech in her. Lambton spoke instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going East with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacFee started. Then he caught Abe&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said peremptorily.
      &ldquo;Wait one minute.&rdquo; There was something in his voice which held Abe back
      for the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say she is going East with you,&rdquo; MacFee said sharply to Lambton.
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; He fastened Lambton with his eyes, and Lambton quailed. &ldquo;Have
      you told her you&rsquo;ve got a wife&mdash;down East? I&rsquo;ve got your history,
      Lambton. Have you told her that you&rsquo;ve got a wife you married when you
      were at college&mdash;and as good a girl as ever lived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had come with terrible suddenness even to Lambton, and he was too dazed
      to make any reply. With a cry of shame and anger Nancy started back.
      Growling with rage and hate, Abe Hawley sprang toward Lambton, but the
      master of the troopers stepped between.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could tell who moved first, or who first made the suggestion, for
      the minds of all were the same, and the general purpose was instantaneous;
      but in the fraction of a minute Lambton, under menace, was on his hands
      and knees crawling to the riverside. Watchful, but not interfering, the
      master of the troopers saw him set adrift in a canoe without a paddle,
      while he was pelted with mud from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at sunrise Abe Hawley and the girl he had waited for so
      long started on the North trail together, MacFee, master of the troopers
      and justice of the peace, handing over the marriage lines.

      THE STROBE OF THE HOUR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t come to-night&mdash;sure.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The girl looked again towards the west, where, here and there, bare poles,
      or branches of trees, or slips of underbrush marked a road made across the
      plains through the snow. The sun was going down golden red, folding up the
      sky a wide soft curtain of pink and mauve and deep purple merging into the
      fathomless blue, where already the stars were beginning to quiver. The
      house stood on the edge of a little forest, which had boldly asserted
      itself in the wide flatness. At this point in the west the prairie merged
      into an undulating territory, where hill and wood rolled away from the
      banks of the Saskatchewan, making another England in beauty. The forest
      was a sort of advance-post of that land of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was beauty too on this prairie, though there was nothing to the
      east but snow and the forest so far as eye could see. Nobility and peace
      and power brooded over the white world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girl looked, it seemed as though the bosom of the land rose and
      fell. She had felt this vibrating life beat beneath the frozen surface.
      Now, as she gazed, she smiled sadly to herself, with drooping eyelids
      looking out from beneath strong brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&mdash;I know you,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take your
      toll. And when you&rsquo;re lying asleep like that, or pretending to, you reach
      up-and kill. And yet you can be kind-ah, but you can be kind and
      beautiful! But you must have your toll one way or t&rsquo;other.&rdquo; She sighed and
      paused; then, after a moment, looking along the trail&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      expect they&rsquo;ll come to-night, and mebbe not to-morrow, if&mdash;if they
      stay for THAT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes closed, she shivered a little. Her lips drew tight, and her face
      seemed suddenly to get thinner. &ldquo;But dad wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;no, he couldn&rsquo;t,
      not considerin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; Again she shut her eyes in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was now turned from the western road by which she had expected
      her travellers, and towards the east, where already the snow was taking on
      a faint bluish tint, a reflection of the sky deepening nightwards in that
      half-circle of the horizon. Distant and a little bleak and cheerless the
      half-circle was looking now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one&mdash;not for two weeks,&rdquo; she said, in comment on the eastern
      trail, which was so little frequented in winter, and this year had been
      less travelled than ever. &ldquo;It would be nice to have a neighbour,&rdquo; she
      added, as she faced the west and the sinking sun again. &ldquo;I get so lonely&mdash;just
      minutes I get lonely. But it&rsquo;s them minutes that seem to count more than
      all the rest when they come. I expect that&rsquo;s it&mdash;we don&rsquo;t live in
      months and years, but just in minutes. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for an
      earthquake to do its work&mdash;it&rsquo;s seconds then.... P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps dad won&rsquo;t
      even come to-morrow,&rdquo; she added, as she laid her hand on the latch. &ldquo;It
      never seemed so long before, not even when he&rsquo;s been away a week.&rdquo; She
      laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Even bad company&rsquo;s better than no company at all. Sure.
      And Mickey has been here always when dad&rsquo;s been away past times. Mickey
      was a fool, but he was company; and mebbe he&rsquo;d have been better company if
      he&rsquo;d been more of a scamp and less a fool. I dunno, but I really think he
      would. Bad company doesn&rsquo;t put you off so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a scratching at the inside of the door. &ldquo;My, if I didn&rsquo;t forget
      Shako,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he dying for a run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door quickly, and out jumped a Russian dog of almost full
      breed, with big, soft eyes like those of his mistress, and with the air of
      the north in every motion&mdash;like his mistress also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Shako, a run&mdash;a run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An instant after she was flying off on a path towards the woods, her short
      skirts flying and showing limbs as graceful and shapely as those of any
      woman of that world of social grace which she had never seen; for she was
      a prairie girl through and through, born on the plains and fed on its
      scanty fare&mdash;scanty as to variety, at least. Backwards and forwards
      they ran, the girl shouting like a child of ten,&mdash;she was
      twenty-three, her eyes flashing, her fine white teeth showing, her hands
      thrown up in sheer excess of animal life, her hair blowing about her
      face-brown, strong hair, wavy and plentiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine creature as she was, her finest features were her eyes and her hands.
      The eyes might have been found in the most savage places; the hands,
      however, only could have come through breeding. She had got them honestly;
      for her mother was descended from an old family of the French province.
      That was why she had the name of Loisette&mdash;and had a touch of
      distinction. It was the strain of the patrician in the full blood of the
      peasant; but it gave her something which made her what she was&mdash;what
      she had been since a child, noticeable and besought, sometimes beloved. It
      was too strong a nature to compel love often, but it never failed to
      compel admiration. Not greatly a creature of words, she had become moody
      of late; and even now, alive with light and feeling and animal life, she
      suddenly stopped her romp and run, and called the dog to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heel, Shako!&rdquo; she said, and made for the door of the little house, which
      looked so snug and home-like. She paused before she came to the door, to
      watch the smoke curling up from the chimney straight as a column, for
      there was not a breath of air stirring. The sun was almost gone and the
      strong bluish light was settling on everything, giving even the green
      spruce trees a curious burnished tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swish! Thud! She faced the woods quickly. It was only a sound that she had
      heard how many hundreds of times! It was the snow slipping from some broad
      branch of the fir trees to the ground. Yet she started now. Something was
      on her mind, agitating her senses, affecting her self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be jumping out of my boots when the fire snaps, or the frost cracks
      the ice, next,&rdquo; she said aloud contemptuously. &ldquo;I dunno what&rsquo;s the matter
      with me. I feel as if someone was hiding somewhere ready to pop out on me.
      I haven&rsquo;t never felt like that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had formed the habit of talking to herself, for it had seemed at
      first, as she was left alone when her father went trapping or upon
      journeys for the Government, that by and by she would start at the sound
      of her own voice, if she didn&rsquo;t think aloud. So she was given to
      soliloquy, defying the old belief that people who talked to themselves
      were going mad. She laughed at that. She said that birds sang to
      themselves and didn&rsquo;t go mad, and crickets chirruped, and frogs croaked,
      and owls hooted, and she would talk and not go crazy either. So she talked
      to herself and to Shako when she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      How quiet it was inside when her light supper was eaten, bread and beans
      and pea-soup&mdash;she had got this from her French mother. Now she sat,
      her elbows on her knees, her chin on her hands, looking into the fire.
      Shako was at her feet upon the great musk-ox rug, which her father had got
      on one of his hunting trips in the Athabasca country years ago. It
      belonged as she belonged. It breathed of the life of the north-land, for
      the timbers of the hut were hewn cedar; the rough chimney, the seats, and
      the shelves on which a few books made a fair show beside the bright tins
      and the scanty crockery, were of pine; and the horned heads of deer and
      wapiti made pegs for coats and caps, and rests for guns and rifles. It was
      a place of comfort; it had an air of well-to-do thrift, even as the girl&rsquo;s
      dress, though plain, was made of good sound stuff, grey, with a touch of
      dark red to match the auburn of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A book lay open in her lap, but she had scarcely tried to read it. She had
      put it down after a few moments fixed upon it. It had sent her thoughts
      off into a world where her life had played a part too big for books, too
      deep for the plummet of any save those who had lived through the storm of
      life&rsquo;s trials; and life when it is bitter to the young is bitter with an
      agony the old never know. At last she spoke to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows now. Now she knows what it is, how it feels&mdash;your heart
      like red-hot coals, and something in your head that&rsquo;s like a turnscrew,
      and you want to die and can&rsquo;t, for you&rsquo;ve got to live and suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she was quiet, and only the dog&rsquo;s heavy breathing, the snap of the
      fire, or the crack of a timber in the deadly frost broke the silence.
      Inside it was warm and bright and home-like; outside it was twenty degrees
      below zero, and like some vast tomb where life itself was congealed, and
      only the white stars, low, twinkling, and quizzical, lived-a life of sharp
      corrosion, not of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she raised her head and listened. The dog did the same. None but
      those whose lives are lived in lonely places can be so acute, so sensitive
      to sound. It was a feeling delicate and intense, the whole nature getting
      the vibration. You could have heard nothing had you been there; none but
      one who was of the wide spaces could have done so. But the dog and the
      woman felt, and both strained towards the window. Again they heard, and
      started to their feet. It was far, far away, and still you could not have
      heard; but now they heard clearly&mdash;a cry in the night, a cry of pain
      and despair. The girl ran to the window and pulled aside the bearskin
      curtain which had completely shut out the light. Then she stirred the
      fire, threw a log upon it, snuffed the candles, hastily put on her
      moccasins, fur coat, wool cap, and gloves, and went to the door quickly,
      the dog at her heels. Opening it, she stepped out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Qui va la? Who is it? Where?&rdquo; she called, and strained towards the west.
      She thought it might be her father or Mickey the hired man, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came from the east, out of the homeless, neighbourless, empty
      east&mdash;a cry, louder now. There were only stars, and the night was
      dark, though not deep dark. She sped along the prairie road as fast as she
      could, once or twice stopping to call aloud. In answer to her calls the
      voice sounded nearer and nearer. Now suddenly she left the trail and bore
      away northward. At last the voice was very near. Presently a figure
      appeared ahead, staggering towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Qui va la? Who is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ba&rsquo;tiste Caron,&rdquo; was the reply in English, in a faint voice. She was
      beside him in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened? Why are you off the trail?&rdquo; she said, and supported
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Injun stoled my dogs and run off,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I run after. Then,
      when I am to come to the trail&rdquo;&mdash;he paused to find the English word,
      and could not&mdash;&ldquo;encore to this trail I no can. So. Ah, bon Dieu, it
      has so awful!&rdquo; He swayed and would have fallen, but she caught him, bore
      him up. She was so strong, and he was as slight as a girl, though tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two nights ago,&rdquo; he answered, and swayed. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said, and pulled a
      flask from her pocket. &ldquo;Drink this-quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised it to his lips, but her hand was still on it, and she only let
      him take a little. Then she drew it away, though she had almost to use
      force, he was so eager for it. Now she took a biscuit from her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat; then some more brandy after,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Come on; it&rsquo;s not far.
      See, there&rsquo;s the light,&rdquo; she added cheerily, raising her head towards the
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it just when I have fall down&mdash;it safe me. I sit down to die&mdash;like
      that! But it safe me, that light&mdash;so. Ah, bon Dieu, it was so far,
      and I want eat so!&rdquo; Already he had swallowed the biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you eat last?&rdquo; she asked, as she urged him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two nights&mdash;except for one leetla piece of bread&mdash;O&mdash;O&mdash;I
      fin&rsquo; it in my pocket. Grace! I have travel so far. Jesu, I think it ees
      ten thousan&rsquo; miles I go. But I mus&rsquo; go on, I mus&rsquo; go&mdash;O&mdash;certainement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light came nearer and nearer. His footsteps quickened, though he
      staggered now and then, and went like a horse that has run its race, but
      is driven upon its course again, going heavily with mouth open and head
      thrown forwards and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mus&rsquo; to get there, an&rsquo; you-you will to help me, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he swayed, but her strong arm held him up. As they ran on, in a kind
      of dog-trot, her hand firm upon his arm&mdash;he seemed not to notice it&mdash;she
      became conscious, though it was half dark, of what sort of man she had
      saved. He was about her own age, perhaps a year or two older, with little,
      if any, hair upon his face, save a slight moustache. His eyes, deep sunken
      as they were, she made out were black, and the face, though drawn and
      famished, had a handsome look. Presently she gave him another sip of
      brandy, and he quickened his steps, speaking to himself the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haf to do it&mdash;if I lif. It is to go, go, go, till I get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now they came to the hut where the firelight flickered on the window-pane;
      the door was flung open, and, as he stumbled on the threshold, she helped
      him into the warm room. She almost pushed him over to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divested of his outer coat, muffler, cap, and leggings, he sat on a bench
      before the fire, his eyes wandering from the girl to the flames, and his
      hands clasping and unclasping between his knees. His eyes dilating with
      hunger, he watched her preparations for his supper; and when at last&mdash;and
      she had been but a moment&mdash;it was placed before him, his head swam,
      and he turned faint with the stress of his longing. He would have
      swallowed a basin of pea-soup at a draught, but she stopped him, holding
      the basin till she thought he might venture again. Then came cold beans,
      and some meat which she toasted at the fire and laid upon his plate. They
      had not spoken since first entering the house, when tears had shone in his
      eyes, and he had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have safe&mdash;ah, you have safe me, and so I will do it yet by help
      bon Dieu&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meat was done at last, and he sat with a great dish of tea beside him,
      and his pipe alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time, if please?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I t&rsquo;ink nine hour, but no sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is near nine,&rdquo; she said. She hastily tidied up the table after his
      meal, and then came and sat in her chair over against the wall of the rude
      fireplace. &ldquo;Nine&mdash;dat is good. The moon rise at &lsquo;leven; den I go. I
      go on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you show me de queeck way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go on&mdash;how can you go on?&rdquo; she asked, almost sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not to show me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Show you what?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queeck way to Askatoon,&rdquo; he said, as though surprised that she should
      ask. &ldquo;They say me if I get here you will tell me queeck way to Askatoon.
      Time, he go so fas&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I have loose a day an&rsquo; a night, an&rsquo; I mus&rsquo; get
      Askatoon if I lif&mdash;I mus&rsquo; get dere in time. It is all safe to de
      stroke of de hour, mais, after, it is&mdash;bon Dieu&mdash;it is hell
      then. Who shall forgif me&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stroke of the hour&mdash;the stroke of the hour!&rdquo; It beat into her
      brain. Were they both thinking of the same thing now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will show me queeck way. I mus&rsquo; be Askatoon in two days, or it is all
      over,&rdquo; he almost moaned. &ldquo;Is no man here&mdash;I forget dat name, my head
      go round like a wheel; but I know dis place, an&rsquo; de good God He help me
      fin&rsquo; my way to where I call out, bien sur. Dat man&rsquo;s name I have forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s name is John Alroyd,&rdquo; she answered absently, for there were
      hammering at her brain the words, &ldquo;The stroke of the hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I get&mdash;yes. An&rsquo; your name, it is Loisette Alroy&rsquo;&mdash;ah, I
      have it in my mind now&mdash;Loisette. I not forget dat name, I not forget
      you&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to go the &lsquo;quick&rsquo; way to Askatoon?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He puffed a moment at his pipe before he answered her. Presently he said,
      holding out his pipe, &ldquo;You not like smoke, mebbe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head in negation, making an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget ask you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dat journee make me forget. When Injun Jo,
      he leave me with the dogs, an&rsquo; I wake up all alone, an&rsquo; not know my way&mdash;not
      like Jo, I think I die, it is so bad, so terrible in my head. Not&rsquo;ing but
      snow, not&rsquo;ing. But dere is de sun; it shine. It say to me, &lsquo;Wake up,
      Ba&rsquo;tiste; it will be all right bime-bye.&rsquo; But all time I t&rsquo;ink I go mad,
      for I mus&rsquo; get Askatoon before&mdash;dat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. Had she not used the same word in thinking of Askatoon.
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to go the &lsquo;quick&rsquo; way to Askatoon?&rdquo; she asked again, her
      face pale, her foot beating the floor impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save him before dat!&rdquo; he answered, as though she knew of what he was
      speaking and thinking. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked. She knew now, surely,
      but she must ask it nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat hanging&mdash;of Haman,&rdquo; he answered. He nodded to himself. Then he
      took to gazing into the fire. His lips moved as though talking to himself,
      and the hand that held the pipe lay forgotten on his knee. &ldquo;What have you
      to do with Haman?&rdquo; she asked slowly, her eyes burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want safe him&mdash;I mus&rsquo; give him free.&rdquo; He tapped his breast. &ldquo;It is
      hereto mak&rsquo; him free.&rdquo; He still tapped his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stood frozen still, her face thin and drawn and white;
      then suddenly the blood rushed back into her face, and a red storm raged
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of the sister, younger than herself, whom Rube Haman had
      married and driven to her grave within a year&mdash;the sweet Lucy, with
      the name of her father&rsquo;s mother. Lucy had been all English in face and
      tongue, a flower of the west, driven to darkness by this horse-dealing
      brute, who, before he was arrested and tried for murder, was about to
      marry Kate Wimper. Kate Wimper had stolen him from Lucy before Lucy&rsquo;s
      first and only child was born, the child that could not survive the warm
      mother-life withdrawn, and so had gone down the valley whither the
      broken-hearted mother had fled. It was Kate Wimper, who, before that, had
      waylaid the one man for whom she herself had ever cared, and drawn him
      from her side by such attractions as she herself would keep for an honest
      wife, if such she ever chanced to be. An honest wife she would have been
      had Kate Wimper not crossed the straight path of her life. The man she had
      loved was gone to his end also, reckless and hopeless, after he had thrown
      away his chance of a lifetime with Loisette Alroyd. There had been left
      behind this girl, to whom tragedy had come too young, who drank
      humiliation with a heart as proud as ever straightly set its course
      through crooked ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had hurt her, twisted her nature a little, given a fountain of
      bitterness to her soul, which welled up and flooded her life sometimes. It
      had given her face no sourness, but it put a shadow into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been glad when Haman was condemned for murder, for she believed he
      had committed it, and ten times hanging could not compensate for that dear
      life gone from their sight&mdash;Lucy, the pride of her father&rsquo;s heart.
      She was glad when Haman was condemned, because of the woman who had stolen
      him from Lucy, because of that other man, her lover, gone out of her own
      life. The new hardness in her rejoiced that now the woman, if she had any
      heart at all, must have it bowed down by this supreme humiliation and
      wrung by the ugly tragedy of the hempen rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now this man before her, this man with a boy&rsquo;s face, with the dark
      luminous eyes, whom she had saved from the frozen plains, he had that in
      his breast which would free Haman, so he had said. A fury had its birth in
      her at that moment. Something seemed to seize her brain and master it,
      something so big that it held all her faculties in perfect control, and
      she felt herself in an atmosphere where all life moved round her
      mechanically, she herself the only sentient thing, so much greater than
      all she saw, or all that she realised by her subconscious self. Everything
      in the world seemed small. How calm it was even with the fury within!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said quietly&mdash;&ldquo;tell me how you are able to save
      Haman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He not kill Wakely. It is my brudder Fadette dat kill and get away. Haman
      he is drunk, and everyt&rsquo;ing seem to say Haman he did it, an&rsquo; everyone know
      Haman is not friend to Wakely. So the juree say he must be hanging. But my
      brudder he go to die with hawful bad cold queeck, an&rsquo; he send for the
      priest an&rsquo; for me, an&rsquo; tell all. I go to Governor with the priest, an&rsquo; 
      Governor gif me dat writing here.&rdquo; He tapped his breast, then took out a
      wallet and showed the paper to her. &ldquo;It is life of dat Haman, voici! And
      so I safe him for my brudder. Dat was a bad boy, Fadette. He was bad all
      time since he was a baby, an&rsquo; I t&rsquo;ink him pretty lucky to die on his bed,
      an&rsquo; get absolve, and go to purgatore. If he not have luck like dat he go
      to hell, an&rsquo; stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and put the wallet back in his breast carefully, his eyes
      half-shut with weariness, his handsome face drawn and thin, his limbs lax
      with fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get Askatoon before de time for dat, I be happy in my heart, for dat
      brudder off mine he get out of purgatore bime-bye, I t&rsquo;ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were almost shut, but he drew himself together with a great
      effort, and added desperately, &ldquo;No sleep. If I sleep it is all smash. Man
      say me I can get Askatoon by dat time from here, if I go queeck way across
      lak&rsquo;&mdash;it is all froze now, dat lak&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; down dat Foxtail Hills.
      Is it so, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the &lsquo;quick&rsquo; way if you can make it in time,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but it is no
      way for the stranger to go. There are always bad spots on the ice&mdash;it
      is not safe. You could not find your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mus&rsquo; get dere in time,&rdquo; he said desperately. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it&mdash;alone,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;Do you want to risk all and lose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned in self-suppression. &ldquo;Long way, I no can get dere in time?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought a moment. &ldquo;No; it can&rsquo;t be done by the long way. But there is
      another way&mdash;a third trail, the trail the Gover&rsquo;ment men made a year
      ago when they came to survey. It is a good trail. It is blazed in the
      woods and staked on the plains. You cannot miss. But&mdash;but there is so
      little time.&rdquo; She looked at the clock on the wall. &ldquo;You cannot leave here
      much before sunrise, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leef when de moon rise, at eleven,&rdquo; he interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had no sleep for two nights, and no food. You can&rsquo;t last it
      out,&rdquo; she said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deliberate look on his face deepened to stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my vow to my brudder&mdash;he is in purgatore. An&rsquo; I mus&rsquo; do it,&rdquo;
       he rejoined, with an emphasis there was no mistaking. &ldquo;You can show me dat
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to a drawer and took out a piece of paper. Then, with a point of
      blackened stick, as he watched her and listened, she swiftly drew his
      route for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I get it in my head,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I go dat way, but I wish&mdash;I
      wish it was dat queeck way. I have no fear, not&rsquo;ing. I go w&rsquo;en dat moon
      rise&mdash;I go, bien sur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must sleep, then, while I get some food for you.&rdquo; She pointed to a
      couch in a corner. &ldquo;I will wake you when the moon rises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time he seemed to realise her, for a moment to leave the
      thing which consumed him, and put his mind upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You not happy&mdash;you not like me here?&rdquo; he asked simply; then added
      quickly, &ldquo;I am not bad man like me brudder&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested on him for a moment as though realising him, while some
      thought was working in her mind behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are not a bad man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Men and women are equal on the
      plains. You have no fear&mdash;I have no fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the rifles on the walls, then back at her. &ldquo;My mudder, she
      was good woman. I am glad she did not lif to know what Fadette do.&rdquo; His
      eyes drank her in for a minute, then he said: &ldquo;I go sleep now, t&rsquo;ank you&mdash;till
      moontime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment his deep breathing filled the room, the only sound save for
      the fire within and the frost outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on. The night deepened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loisette sat beside the fire, but her body was half-turned from it towards
      the man on the sofa. She was not agitated outwardly, but within there was
      that fire which burns up life and hope and all the things that come
      between us and great issues. It had burned up everything in her except one
      thought, one powerful motive. She had been deeply wronged, and justice had
      been about to give &ldquo;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.&rdquo; But the
      man lying there had come to sweep away the scaffolding of justice&mdash;he
      had come for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he might arrive at Askatoon before the stroke of the hour, but
      still he would be too late, for in her pocket now was the Governor&rsquo;s
      reprieve. The man had slept soundly. His wallet was still in his breast;
      but the reprieve was with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he left without discovering his loss, and got well on his way, and
      discovered it then, it would be too late. If he returned&mdash;she only
      saw one step before her, she would wait for that, and deal with it when it
      came. She was thinking of Lucy, of her own lover ruined and gone. She was
      calm in her madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first light of the moon she roused him. She had put food into his
      fur-coat pocket, and after he had drunk a bowl of hot pea-soup, while she
      told him his course again, she opened the door, and he passed out into the
      night. He started forward without a word, but came back again and caught
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I go forget everyt&rsquo;ing except dat. But I t&rsquo;ink what
      you do for me, it is better than all my life. Bien sur, I will come again,
      when I get my mind to myself. Ah, but you are beautibul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; 
      you not happy. Well, I come again&mdash;yes, a Dieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone into the night, with the moon silvering the sky, and the
      steely frost eating into the sentient life of this northern world. Inside
      the house, with the bearskin blind dropped at the window again, and the
      fire blazing high, Loisette sat with the Governor&rsquo;s reprieve in her hand.
      Looking at it, she wondered why it had been given to Ba&rsquo;tiste Caron, and
      not to a police-officer. Ah yes, it was plain&mdash;Ba&rsquo;tiste was a
      woodsman and plainsman, and could go far more safely than a constable, and
      faster. Ba&rsquo;tiste had reason for going fast, and he would travel night and
      day&mdash;he was travelling night and day indeed. And now Ba&rsquo;tiste might
      get there, but the reprieve would not. He would not be able to stop the
      hanging of Haman&mdash;the hanging of Rube Haman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A change came over her. Her eyes blazed, her breast heaved now. She had
      been so quiet, so cold and still. But life seemed moving in her once
      again. The woman, Kate Wimper, who had helped to send two people to their
      graves, would now drink the dregs of shame, if she was capable of shame&mdash;would
      be robbed of her happiness, if so be she loved Rube Haman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, as though to put the paper in the fire, but paused suddenly
      at one thought&mdash;Rube Haman was innocent of murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, he was not innocent of Lucy&rsquo;s misery and death, of the death of
      the little one who only opened its eyes to the light for an instant, and
      then went into the dark again. But truly she was justified! When Haman was
      gone things would go on just the same&mdash;and she had been so bitter,
      her heart had been pierced as with a knife these past three years. Again
      she held out her hand to the fire, but suddenly she gave a little cry and
      put her hand to her head. There was Ba&rsquo;tiste!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Ba&rsquo;tiste to her? Nothing-nothing at all. She had saved his life&mdash;even
      if she wronged Ba&rsquo;tiste, her debt would be paid. No, she would not think
      of Ba&rsquo;tiste. Yet she did not put the paper in the fire, but in the pocket
      of her dress. Then she went to her room, leaving the door open. The bed
      was opposite the fire, and, as she lay there&mdash;she did not take off
      her clothes, she knew not why-she could see the flames. She closed her
      eyes, but could not sleep, and more than once when she opened them she
      thought she saw Ba&rsquo;tiste sitting there as he had sat hours before. Why did
      Ba&rsquo;tiste haunt her so? What was it he had said in his broken English as he
      went away?&mdash;that he would come back; that she was &ldquo;beautibul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once as she lay still, her head throbbing, her feet and hands icy
      cold, she sat up listening. &ldquo;Ah-again!&rdquo; she cried. She sprang from her
      bed, rushed to the door, and strained her eyes into the silver night. She
      called into the icy void, &ldquo;Qui va la? Who goes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forwards, her hand at her ear, but no sound came in reply. Once
      more she called, but nothing answered. The night was all light and frost
      and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had only heard, in her own brain, the iteration of Ba&rsquo;tiste&rsquo;s calling.
      Would he reach Askatoon in time, she wondered, as she shut the door? Why
      had she not gone with him and attempted the shorter way the quick way, he
      had called it? All at once the truth came back upon her, stirring her now.
      It would do no good for Ba&rsquo;tiste to arrive in time. He might plead to them
      all and tell the truth about the reprieve, but it would not avail&mdash;Rube
      Haman would hang. That did not matter&mdash;even though he was innocent;
      but Ba&rsquo;tiste&rsquo;s brother would be so long in purgatory. And even that would
      not matter; but she would hurt Ba&rsquo;tiste&mdash;Ba&rsquo;tiste&mdash;Ba&rsquo;tiste. And
      Ba&rsquo;tiste he would know that she&mdash;and he had called her &ldquo;beautibul,&rdquo;
       that she had&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry she suddenly clothed herself for travel. She put some food and
      drink in a leather bag and slung them over her shoulder. Then she dropped
      on a knee and wrote a note to her father, tears falling from her eyes. She
      heaped wood on the fire and moved towards the door. All at once she turned
      to the crucifix on the wall which had belonged to her mother, and, though
      she had followed her father&rsquo;s Protestant religion, she kissed the feet of
      the sacred figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Christ, have mercy on me, and bring me safe to my journey&rsquo;s end-in
      time,&rdquo; she said breathlessly; then she went softly to the door, leaving
      the dog behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It opened, closed, and the night swallowed her. Like a ghost she sped the
      quick way to Askatoon. She was six hours behind Ba&rsquo;tiste, and, going hard
      all the time, it was doubtful if she could get there before the fatal
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the trail Ba&rsquo;tiste had taken there were two huts where he could rest,
      and he had carried his blanket slung on his shoulder. The way she went
      gave no shelter save the trees and caves which had been used to cache
      buffalo meat and hides in old days. But beyond this there was danger in
      travelling by night, for the springs beneath the ice of the three lakes
      she must, cross made it weak and rotten even in the fiercest weather, and
      what would no doubt have been death to Ba&rsquo;tiste would be peril at least to
      her. Why had she not gone with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had in his face what was in Lucy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said to herself, as she sped
      on. &ldquo;She was fine like him, ready to break her heart for those she cared
      for. My, if she had seen him first instead of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, for the ice gave way to her foot, and she only sprang
      back in time to save herself. But she trotted on, mile after mile, the
      dog-trot of the Indian, head bent forwards, toeing in, breathing steadily
      but sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, noon, then a fall of snow and a keen wind, and despair
      in her heart; but she had passed the danger-spots, and now, if the storm
      did not overwhelm her, she might get to Askatoon in time. In the midst of
      the storm she came to one of the caves of which she had known. Here was
      wood for a fire, and here she ate, and in weariness unspeakable fell
      asleep. When she waked it was near sun-down, the storm had ceased, and, as
      on the night before, the sky was stained with colour and drowned in
      splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it&mdash;I will do it, Ba&rsquo;tiste!&rdquo; she called, and laughed aloud
      into the sunset. She had battled with herself all the way, and she had
      conquered. Right was right, and Rube Haman must not be hung for what he
      did not do. Her heart hardened whenever she thought of the woman, but
      softened again when she thought of Ba&rsquo;tiste, who had to suffer for the
      deed of a brother in &ldquo;purgatore.&rdquo; Once again the night and its silence and
      loneliness followed her, the only living thing near the trail till long
      after midnight. After that, as she knew, there were houses here and there
      where she might have rested, but she pushed on unceasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak she fell in with a settler going to Askatoon with his dogs.
      Seeing how exhausted she was, he made her ride a few miles upon his
      sledge; then she sped on ahead again till she came to the borders of
      Askatoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      People were already in the streets, and all were tending one way. She
      stopped and asked the time. It was within a quarter of an hour of the time
      when Haman was to pay another&rsquo;s penalty. She spurred herself on, and came
      to the jail blind with fatigue. As she neared the jail she saw her father
      and Mickey. In amazement her father hailed her, but she would not stop.
      She was admitted to the prison on explaining that she had a reprieve.
      Entering a room filled with excited people, she heard a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came from Ba&rsquo;tiste. He had arrived but ten minutes before, and, in the
      Sheriff&rsquo;s presence had discovered his loss. He had appealed in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as he saw the girl, he gave a shout of joy which pierced the
      hearts of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you haf it! Say you haf it, or it is no use&mdash;he mus&rsquo; hang.
      Spik-spik! Ah, my brudder&mdash;it is to do him right! Ah, Loisette&mdash;bon
      Dieu, merci!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer she placed the reprieve in the hands of the Sheriff. Then she
      swayed and fell fainting at the feet of Ba&rsquo;tiste.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come at the stroke of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left for her home again the Sheriff kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was not the only time he kissed her. He did it again six months
      later, at the beginning of the harvest, when she and Ba&rsquo;tiste Caron
      started off on the long trail of life together. None but Ba&rsquo;tiste knew the
      truth about the loss of the reprieve, and to him she was &ldquo;beautibul&rdquo; just
      the same, and greatly to be desired.

      BUCKMASTER&rsquo;S BOY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bin waitin&rsquo; for him, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll git him of it takes all winter. I&rsquo;ll git
      him&mdash;plumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker smoothed the barrel of his rifle with mittened hand, which
      had, however, a trigger-finger free. With black eyebrows twitching over
      sunken grey eyes, he looked doggedly down the frosty valley from the ledge
      of high rock where he sat. The face was rough and weather-beaten, with the
      deep tan got in the open life of a land of much sun and little cloud, and
      he had a beard which, untrimmed and growing wild, made him look ten years
      older than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bin waitin&rsquo; a durn while,&rdquo; the mountain-man added, and got to his feet
      slowly, drawing himself out to six and a half feet of burly manhood. The
      shoulders were, however, a little stooped, and the head was thrust
      forwards with an eager, watchful look&mdash;a habit become a physical
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he caught sight of a hawk sailing southward along the peaks of
      the white icebound mountains above, on which the sun shone with such sharp
      insistence, making sky and mountain of a piece in deep purity and serene
      stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hawk&rsquo;s seen him, mebbe,&rdquo; he said, after a moment. &ldquo;I bet it went up
      higher when it got him in its eye. Ef it&rsquo;d only speak and tell me where he
      is&mdash;ef he&rsquo;s a day, or two days, or ten days north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his eyes blazed and his mouth opened in superstitious amazement,
      for the hawk stopped almost directly overhead at a great height, and swept
      round in a circle many times, waveringly, uncertainly. At last it resumed
      its flight southward, sliding down the mountains like a winged star.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mountaineer watched it with a dazed expression for a moment longer,
      then both hands clutched the rifle and half swung it to position
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seen him, and it stopped to say so. It&rsquo;s seen him, I tell you, an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll git him. Ef it&rsquo;s an hour, or a day, or a week, it&rsquo;s all the same. I&rsquo;m
      here watchin&rsquo;, waitin&rsquo; dead on to him, the poison skunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person to whom he had been speaking now rose from the pile of cedar
      boughs where he had been sitting, stretched his arms up, then shook
      himself into place, as does a dog after sleep. He stood for a minute
      looking at the mountaineer with a reflective, yet a furtively sardonic,
      look. He was not above five feet nine inches in height, and he was slim
      and neat; and though his buckskin coat and breeches were worn and even
      frayed in spots, he had an air of some distinction and of concentrated
      force. It was a face that men turned to look at twice and shook their
      heads in doubt afterwards&mdash;a handsome, worn, secretive face, in as
      perfect control as the strings of an instrument under the bow of a great
      artist. It was the face of a man without purpose in life beyond the moment&mdash;watchful,
      careful, remorselessly determined, an adventurer&rsquo;s asset, the dial-plate
      of a hidden machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he took the handsome meerschaum pipe from his mouth, from which he had
      been puffing smoke slowly, and said in a cold, yet quiet voice, &ldquo;How long
      you been waitin&rsquo;, Buck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month. He&rsquo;s overdue near that. He always comes down to winter at Fort
      o&rsquo; Comfort, with his string of half-breeds, an&rsquo; Injuns, an&rsquo; the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No chance to get him at the Fort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so certain. They&rsquo;d guess what I was doin&rsquo; there. It&rsquo;s surer
      here. He&rsquo;s got to come down the trail, an&rsquo; when I spot him by the Juniper
      clump&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked an arm towards a spot almost a mile farther up the
      valley&mdash;&ldquo;I kin scoot up the underbrush a bit and git him&mdash;plumb.
      I could do it from here, sure, but I don&rsquo;t want no mistake. Once only,
      jest one shot, that&rsquo;s all I want, Sinnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bit off a small piece of tobacco from a black plug Sinnet offered him,
      and chewed it with nervous fierceness, his eyebrows working, as he looked
      at the other eagerly. Deadly as his purpose was, and grim and unvarying as
      his vigil had been, the loneliness had told on him, and he had grown
      hungry for a human face and human companionship. Why Sinnet had come he
      had not thought to inquire. Why Sinnet should be going north instead of
      south had not occurred to him. He only realised that Sinnet was not the
      man he was waiting for with murder in his heart; and all that mattered to
      him in life was the coming of his victim down the trail. He had welcomed
      Sinnet with a sullen eagerness, and had told him in short, detached
      sentences the dark story of a wrong and a waiting revenge, which brought a
      slight flush to Sinnet&rsquo;s pale face and awakened a curious light in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your shack&mdash;that where you shake down?&rdquo; Sinnet said,
      pointing towards a lean-to in the fir trees to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I sleep there. It&rsquo;s straight on to the Juniper clump, the
      front door is.&rdquo; He laughed viciously, grimly. &ldquo;Outside or inside, I&rsquo;m on
      to the Juniper clump. Walk into the parlour?&rdquo; he added, and drew open a
      rough-made door, so covered with green cedar boughs that it seemed of a
      piece with the surrounding underbrush and trees. Indeed, the little but
      was so constructed that it could not be distinguished from the woods even
      a short distance away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have a fire, I suppose?&rdquo; Sinnet asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not daytimes. Smoke &lsquo;d give me away if he suspicioned me,&rdquo; answered the
      mountaineer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take no chances. Never can tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water?&rdquo; asked Sinnet, as though interested in the surroundings, while all
      the time he was eyeing the mountaineer furtively&mdash;as it were, prying
      to the inner man, or measuring the strength of the outer man. He lighted a
      fresh pipe and seated himself on a rough bench beside the table in the
      middle of the room, and leaned on his elbows, watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mountaineer laughed. It was not a pleasant laugh to hear. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You bin a long time out West. You bin in the mountains a good
      while. Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Sinnet listened intently. He heard the faint drip,
      drip, drip of water, and looked steadily at the back wall of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;rock?&rdquo; he said, and jerked his head towards the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got good ears,&rdquo; answered the other, and drew aside a blanket which
      hung on the back wall of the room. A wooden trough was disclosed hanging
      under a ledge of rock, and water dripped into it softly, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost providential, that rock,&rdquo; remarked Sinnet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your well
      at your back door. Food&mdash;but you can&rsquo;t go far, and keep your eye on
      the Bend too,&rdquo; he nodded towards the door, beyond which lay the
      frost-touched valley in the early morning light of autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of black squirrels and pigeons come here on account of the springs
      like this one, and I get &lsquo;em with a bow and arrow. I didn&rsquo;t call myself
      Robin Hood and Daniel Boone not for nothin&rsquo; when I was knee-high to a
      grasshopper.&rdquo; He drew from a rough cupboard some cold game, and put it on
      the table, with some scones and a pannikin of water. Then he brought out a
      small jug of whiskey and placed it beside his visitor. They began to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye cook without fire?&rdquo; asked Sinnet. &ldquo;Fire&rsquo;s all right at nights.
      He&rsquo;d never camp &lsquo;twixt here an&rsquo; Juniper Bend at night. The next camp&rsquo;s six
      miles north from here. He&rsquo;d only come down the valley daytimes. I studied
      it &lsquo;all out, and it&rsquo;s a dead sure thing. From daylight till dusk I&rsquo;m on to
      him. I got the trail in my eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed his teeth like a wild dog, as his look swept the valley. There
      was something almost revolting in his concentrated ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet&rsquo;s eyes half closed as he watched the mountaineer, and the long,
      scraggy hands and whipcord neck seemed to interest him greatly. He looked
      at his own slim brown hands with a half smile, and it was almost as cruel
      as the laugh of the other. Yet it had, too, a knowledge and an
      understanding which gave it humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he did it?&rdquo; Sinnet asked presently, after drinking a very
      small portion of liquor, and tossing some water from the pannikin after
      it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure Greevy killed your boy, Buck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Buckmaster, ain&rsquo;t it&mdash;Jim Buckmaster? Don&rsquo;t I know my own
      name? It&rsquo;s as sure as that. My boy said it was Greevy when he was dying.
      He told Bill Ricketts so, and Bill told me afore he went East. Bill didn&rsquo;t
      want to tell, but he said it was fair I should know, for my boy never did
      nobody any harm&mdash;an&rsquo; Greevy&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; on. But I&rsquo;ll git him. Right&rsquo;s
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for the law to hang him, if you&rsquo;ve got the proof,
      Buck? A year or so in jail, an&rsquo; a long time to think over what&rsquo;s going
      round his neck on the scaffold&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t that suit you, if you&rsquo;ve got
      the proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rigid, savage look came into Buckmaster&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t lettin&rsquo; no judge and jury do my business. I&rsquo;m for certain sure,
      not for p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps! An&rsquo; I want to do it myself. Clint was only twenty. Like
      boys we was together. I was eighteen when I married, an&rsquo; he come when she
      went&mdash;jest a year&mdash;jest a year. An&rsquo; ever since then we lived
      together, him an&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; shot together, an&rsquo; trapped together, an&rsquo; went
      gold-washin&rsquo; together on the Cariboo, an&rsquo; eat out of the same dish, an&rsquo; 
      slept under the same blanket, and jawed together nights&mdash;ever since
      he was five, when old Mother Lablache had got him into pants, an&rsquo; he was
      fit to take the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stopped a minute, his whipcord neck swelling, his lips
      twitching. He brought a fist down on the table with a bang. &ldquo;The biggest
      little rip he was, as full of fun as a squirrel, an&rsquo; never a smile-o-jest
      his eyes dancin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; more sense than a judge. He laid hold o&rsquo; me, that
      cub did&mdash;it was like his mother and himself together; an&rsquo; the years
      flowin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; peterin&rsquo; out, an&rsquo; him gettin&rsquo; older, an&rsquo; always jest the
      same. Always on rock-bottom, always bright as a dollar, an&rsquo; we livin&rsquo; at
      Black Nose Lake, layin&rsquo; up cash agin&rsquo; the time we was to go South, an&rsquo; set
      up a house along the railway, an&rsquo; him to git married. I was for his
      gittin&rsquo; married same as me, when we had enough cash. I use to think of
      that when he was ten, and when he was eighteen I spoke to him about it;
      but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen&mdash;jest laughed at me. You remember how Clint
      used to laugh sort of low and teasin&rsquo; like&mdash;you remember that laugh
      o&rsquo; Clint&rsquo;s, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet&rsquo;s face was towards the valley and Juniper Bend, but he slowly
      turned his head and looked at Buckmaster strangely out of his half-shut
      eyes. He took the pipe from his mouth slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hear it now,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;I hear it often, Buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man gripped his arm so suddenly that Sinnet was startled,&mdash;in
      so far as anything could startle anyone who had lived a life of chance and
      danger and accident, and his face grew a shade paler; but he did not move,
      and Buckmaster&rsquo;s hand tightened convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liked him, an&rsquo; he liked you; he first learnt poker off you, Sinnet.
      He thought you was a tough, but he didn&rsquo;t mind that no more than I did. It
      ain&rsquo;t for us to say what we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be, not always. Things in life git
      stronger than we are. You was a tough, but who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to judge you! I
      ain&rsquo;t; for Clint took to you, Sinnet, an&rsquo; he never went wrong in his
      thinkin&rsquo;. God! he was wife an&rsquo; child to me&mdash;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s grief was a painful thing to see. His hands gripped the table,
      while his body shook with sobs, though his eyes gave forth no tears. It
      was an inward convulsion, which gave his face the look of unrelieved
      tragedy and suffering&mdash;Laocoon struggling with the serpents of sorrow
      and hatred which were strangling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead an&rsquo; gone,&rdquo; he repeated, as he swayed to and fro, and the table
      quivered in his grasp. Presently, however, as though arrested by a
      thought, he peered out of the doorway towards Juniper Bend. &ldquo;That hawk
      seen him&mdash;it seen him. He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;, I know it, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll git him&mdash;plumb.&rdquo;
       He had the mystery and imagination of the mountain-dweller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rifle lay against the wall behind him, and he turned and touched it
      almost caressingly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t let go like this since he was killed, Sinnet.
      It don&rsquo;t do. I got to keep myself stiddy to do the trick when the minute
      comes. At first I usen&rsquo;t to sleep at nights, thinkin&rsquo; of Clint, an&rsquo; 
      missin&rsquo; him, an&rsquo; I got shaky and no good. So I put a cinch on myself, an&rsquo; 
      got to sleepin&rsquo; again&mdash;from the full dusk to dawn, for Greevy
      wouldn&rsquo;t take the trail at night. I&rsquo;ve kept stiddy.&rdquo; He held out his hand
      as though to show that it was firm and steady, but it trembled with the
      emotion which had conquered him. He saw it, and shook his head angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was seein&rsquo; you, Sinnet. It burst me. I ain&rsquo;t seen no one to speak to
      in a month, an&rsquo; with you sittin&rsquo; there, it was like Clint an&rsquo; me cuttin&rsquo; 
      and comin&rsquo; again off the loaf an&rsquo; the knuckle-bone of ven&rsquo;son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet ran a long finger slowly across his lips, and seemed meditating
      what he should say to the mountaineer. At length he spoke, looking into
      Buckmaster&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What was the story Ricketts told you? What did your
      boy tell Ricketts? I&rsquo;ve heard, too, about it, and that&rsquo;s why I asked you
      if you had proofs that Greevy killed Clint. Of course, Clint should know,
      and if he told Ricketts, that&rsquo;s pretty straight; but I&rsquo;d like to know if
      what I heard tallies with what Ricketts heard from Clint. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it&rsquo;d
      ease your mind a bit to tell it. I&rsquo;ll watch the Bend&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
      trouble about that. You can&rsquo;t do these two things at one time. I&rsquo;ll watch
      for Greevy; you give me Clint&rsquo;s story to Ricketts. I guess you know I&rsquo;m
      feelin&rsquo; for you, an&rsquo; if I was in your place I&rsquo;d shoot the man that killed
      Clint, if it took ten years. I&rsquo;d have his heart&rsquo;s blood&mdash;all of it.
      Whether Greevy was in the right or in the wrong, I&rsquo;d have him&mdash;plumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckmaster was moved. He gave a fierce exclamation and made a gesture of
      cruelty. &ldquo;Clint right or wrong? There ain&rsquo;t no question of that. My boy
      wasn&rsquo;t the kind to be in the wrong. What did he ever do but what was
      right? If Clint was in the wrong I&rsquo;d kill Greevy jest the same, for Greevy
      robbed him of all the years that was before him&mdash;only a sapling he
      was, an&rsquo; all his growin&rsquo; to do, all his branches to widen an&rsquo; his roots to
      spread. But that don&rsquo;t enter in it, his bein&rsquo; in the wrong. It was a
      quarrel, and Clint never did Greevy any harm. It was a quarrel over cards,
      an&rsquo; Greevy was drunk, an&rsquo; followed Clint out into the prairie in the night
      and shot him like a coyote. Clint hadn&rsquo;t no chance, an&rsquo; he jest lay there
      on the ground till morning, when Ricketts and Steve Joicey found him. An&rsquo; 
      Clint told Ricketts who it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Ricketts tell it right out at once?&rdquo; asked Sinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greevy was his own cousin&mdash;it was in the family, an&rsquo; he kept
      thinkin&rsquo; of Greevy&rsquo;s gal, Em&rsquo;ly. Her&mdash;what&rsquo;ll it matter to her!
      She&rsquo;ll get married, an she&rsquo;ll forgit. I know her, a gal that&rsquo;s got no deep
      feelin&rsquo; like Clint had for me. But because of her Ricketts didn&rsquo;t speak
      for a year. Then he couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer, an&rsquo; he told me&mdash;seein&rsquo; 
      how I suffered, an&rsquo; everybody hidin&rsquo; their suspicions from me, an&rsquo; me up
      here out o&rsquo; the way, an&rsquo; no account. That was the feelin&rsquo; among &lsquo;em&mdash;what
      was the good of making things worse! They wasn&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; of the boy or of
      Jim Buckmaster, his father. They was thinkin&rsquo; of Greevy&rsquo;s gal&mdash;to
      save her trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet&rsquo;s face was turned towards Juniper Bend, and the eyes were fixed, as
      it were, on a still more distant object&mdash;a dark, brooding,
      inscrutable look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all Ricketts told you, Buck?&rdquo; The voice was very quiet, but it
      had a suggestive note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all Clint told Bill before he died. That was enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, and then, puffing out long clouds of smoke,
      and in a tone of curious detachment, as though he were telling of
      something that he saw now in the far distance, or as a spectator of a
      battle from a far vantage-point might report to a blind man standing near,
      Sinnet said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Ricketts didn&rsquo;t know the whole story; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Clint didn&rsquo;t know
      it all to tell him; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Clint didn&rsquo;t remember it all. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he
      didn&rsquo;t remember anything except that he and Greevy quarrelled, and that
      Greevy and he shot at each other in the prairie. He&rsquo;d only be thinking of
      the thing that mattered most to him&mdash;that his life was over, an&rsquo; that
      a man had put a bullet in him, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckmaster tried to interrupt him, but he waved a hand impatiently, and
      continued: &ldquo;As I say, maybe he didn&rsquo;t remember everything; he had been
      drinkin&rsquo; a bit himself, Clint had. He wasn&rsquo;t used to liquor, and couldn&rsquo;t
      stand much. Greevy was drunk, too, and gone off his head with rage. He
      always gets drunk when he first comes South to spend the winter with his
      girl Em&rsquo;ly.&rdquo; He paused a moment, then went on a little more quickly.
      &ldquo;Greevy was proud of her&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t even bear her being crossed in any
      way; and she has a quick temper, and if she quarrelled with anybody Greevy
      quarrelled too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about her,&rdquo; broke in Buckmaster roughly.
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t in this thing. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to git Greevy. I bin waitin&rsquo; for him,
      an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll git him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to kill the man that killed your boy, if you can, Buck; but
      I&rsquo;m telling my story in my own way. You told Ricketts&rsquo;s story; I&rsquo;ll tell
      what I&rsquo;ve heard. And before you kill Greevy you ought to know all there is
      that anybody else knows&mdash;or suspicions about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know enough. Greevy done it, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; With no apparent coherence
      and relevancy Sinnet continued, but his voice was not so even as before.
      &ldquo;Em&rsquo;ly was a girl that wasn&rsquo;t twice alike. She was changeable. First it
      was one, then it was another, and she didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to fix her
      mind. But that didn&rsquo;t prevent her leadin&rsquo; men on. She wasn&rsquo;t changeable,
      though, about her father. She was to him what your boy was to you. There
      she was like you, ready to give everything up for her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell y&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to hear about her,&rdquo; said Buckmaster, getting to
      his feet and setting his jaws. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t talk to me about her. She&rsquo;ll
      git over it. I&rsquo;ll never git over what Greevy done to me or to Clint&mdash;jest
      twenty, jest twenty! I got my work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his gun from the wall, slung it into the hollow of his arm, and
      turned to look up the valley through the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was sparkling with life&mdash;the life and vigour which a
      touch of frost gives to the autumn world in a country where the blood
      tingles to the dry, sweet sting of the air. Beautiful, and spacious, and
      buoyant, and lonely, the valley and the mountains seemed waiting, like a
      new-born world, to be peopled by man. It was as though all had been made
      ready for him&mdash;the birds whistling and singing in the trees, the
      whisk of the squirrels leaping from bough to bough, the peremptory sound
      of the woodpecker&rsquo;s beak against the bole of a tree, the rustle of the
      leaves as a wood-hen ran past&mdash;a waiting, virgin world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its beauty and its wonderful dignity had no appeal to Buckmaster. His eyes
      and mind were fixed on a deed which would stain the virgin wild with the
      ancient crime that sent the first marauder on human life into the
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Buckmaster&rsquo;s figure darkened the doorway Sinnet seemed to waken as from
      a dream, and he got swiftly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;you wait, Buck. You&rsquo;ve got to hear all. You haven&rsquo;t heard my
      story yet. Wait, I tell you.&rdquo; His voice was so sharp and insistent, so
      changed, that Buckmaster turned from the doorway and came back into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of my hearin&rsquo;? You want me not to kill Greevy, because of
      that gal. What&rsquo;s she to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to you, Buck, but Clint was everything to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mountaineer stood like one petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&mdash;what&rsquo;s that you say? It&rsquo;s a damn lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t cards&mdash;the quarrel, not the real quarrel. Greevy found
      Clint kissing her. Greevy wanted her to marry Gatineau, the lumber-king.
      That was the quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A snarl was on the face of Buckmaster. &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll not be sorry when I
      git him. It took Clint from her as well as from me.&rdquo; He turned to the door
      again. &ldquo;But, wait, Buck, wait one minute and hear&mdash;&rdquo; He was
      interrupted by a low, exultant growl, and he saw Buckmaster&rsquo;s rifle
      clutched as a hunter, stooping, clutches his gun to fire on his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, the spy-glass!&rdquo; he flung back at Sinnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll
      make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet caught the telescope from the nails where it hung, and looked out
      towards Juniper Bend. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Greevy&mdash;and his girl, and the
      half-breeds,&rdquo; he said, with a note in his voice that almost seemed
      agitation, and yet few had ever seen Sinnet agitated. &ldquo;Em&rsquo;ly must have
      gone up the trail in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn now,&rdquo; the mountaineer said hoarsely, and, stooping, slid
      away quickly into the undergrowth. Sinnet followed, keeping near him,
      neither speaking. For a half mile they hastened on, and now and then
      Buckmaster drew aside the bushes, and looked up the valley, to keep Greevy
      and his bois brulees in his eye. Just so had he and his son and Sinnet
      stalked the wapiti and the red deer along these mountains; but this was a
      man that Buckmaster was stalking now, with none of the joy of the sport
      which had been his since a lad; only the malice of the avenger. The lust
      of a mountain feud was on him; he was pursuing the price of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Buckmaster stopped at a ledge of rock just above the trail. Greevy
      would pass below, within three hundred yards of his rifle. He turned to
      Sinnet with cold and savage eyes. &ldquo;You go back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my
      business. I don&rsquo;t want you to see. You don&rsquo;t want to see, then you won&rsquo;t
      know, and you won&rsquo;t need to lie. You said that the man that killed Clint
      ought to die. He&rsquo;s going to die, but it&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; your business. I want to
      be alone. In a minute he&rsquo;ll be where I kin git him&mdash;plumb. You go,
      Sinnet-right off. It&rsquo;s my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange, desperate look in Sinnet&rsquo;s face; it was as hard as
      stone, but his eyes had a light of battle in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my business right enough, Buck,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re not going to
      kill Greevy. That girl of his has lost her lover, your boy. It&rsquo;s broke her
      heart almost, and there&rsquo;s no use making her an orphan too. She can&rsquo;t stand
      it. She&rsquo;s had enough. You leave her father alone&mdash;you hear me, let
      up!&rdquo; He stepped between Buckmaster and the ledge of rock from which the
      mountaineer was to take aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a terrible look in Buckmaster&rsquo;s face. He raised his
      single-barrelled rifle, as though he would shoot Sinnet; but, at the
      moment, he remembered that a shot would warn Greevy, and that he might not
      have time to reload. He laid his rifle against a tree swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git away from here,&rdquo; he said, with a strange rattle in his throat. &ldquo;Git
      away quick; he&rsquo;ll be down past here in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet pulled himself together as he saw Buckmaster snatch at a great
      clasp-knife in his belt. He jumped and caught Buckmaster&rsquo;s wrist in a grip
      like a vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greevy didn&rsquo;t kill him, Buck,&rdquo; he said. But the mountaineer was gone mad,
      and did not grasp the meaning of the words. He twined his left arm round
      the neck of Sinnet, and the struggle began, he fighting to free Sinnet&rsquo;s
      hand from his wrist, to break Sinnet&rsquo;s neck. He did not realise what he
      was doing. He only knew that this man stood between him and the murderer
      of his boy, and all the ancient forces of barbarism were alive in him.
      Little by little they drew to the edge of the rock, from which there was a
      sheer drop of two hundred feet. Sinnet fought like a panther for safety,
      but no sane man&rsquo;s strength could withstand the demoniacal energy that bent
      and crushed him. Sinnet felt his strength giving. Then he said in a hoarse
      whisper, &ldquo;Greevy didn&rsquo;t kill him. I killed him, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he was borne to the ground with a hand on his throat, and
      an instant after the knife went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckmaster got to his feet and looked at his victim for an instant, dazed
      and wild; then he sprang for his gun. As he did so the words that Sinnet
      had said as they struggled rang in his ears, &ldquo;Greevy didn&rsquo;t kill him; I
      killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a low cry and turned back towards Sinnet, who lay in a pool of
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinnet was speaking. He went and stooped over him. &ldquo;Em&rsquo;ly threw me over
      for Clint,&rdquo; the voice said huskily, &ldquo;and I followed to have it out with
      Clint. So did Greevy, but Greevy was drunk. I saw them meet. I was hid. I
      saw that Clint would kill Greevy, and I fired. I was off my head&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      never cared for any woman before, and Greevy was her father. Clint was off
      his head too. He had called me names that day&mdash;a cardsharp, and a
      liar, and a thief, and a skunk, he called me, and I hated him just then.
      Greevy fired twice wide. He didn&rsquo;t know but what he killed Clint, but he
      didn&rsquo;t. I did. So I tried to stop you, Buck&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Life was going fast, and speech failed him; but he opened his eyes again
      and whispered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to die, Buck. I am only thirty-five, and
      it&rsquo;s too soon; but it had to be. Don&rsquo;t look that way, Buck. You got the
      man that killed him&mdash;plumb. But Em&rsquo;ly didn&rsquo;t play fair with me&mdash;made
      a fool of me, the only time in my life I ever cared for a woman. You leave
      Greevy alone, Buck, and tell Em&rsquo;ly for me I wouldn&rsquo;t let you kill her
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;Sinnet&mdash;you, you done it! Why, he&rsquo;d have fought for you.
      You&mdash;done it&mdash;to him&mdash;to Clint!&rdquo; Now that the blood-feud
      had been satisfied, a great change came over the mountaineer. He had done
      his work, and the thirst for vengeance was gone. Greevy he had hated, but
      this man had been with him in many a winter&rsquo;s hunt. His brain could hardly
      grasp the tragedy&mdash;it had all been too sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stooped down. &ldquo;Sinnet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ef there was a woman in it,
      that makes all the difference. Sinnet, of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sinnet was gone upon a long trail that led into an illimitable
      wilderness. With a moan the old man ran to the ledge of rock. Greevy and
      his girl were below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When there&rsquo;s a woman in it&mdash;!&rdquo; he said, in a voice of helplessness
      and misery, and watched Em&rsquo;ly till she disappeared from view. Then he
      turned, and, lifting up in his arms the man he had killed, carried him
      into the deeper woods.

    <h2>
      TO-MORROW
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, nothing&rsquo;s the matter with the world to-day! It&rsquo;s so good it almost
      hurts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head from the white petticoat she was ironing, and gazed
      out of the doorway and down the valley with a warm light in her eyes and a
      glowing face. The snow-tipped mountains far above and away, the
      fir-covered, cedar-ranged foothills, and, lower down, the wonderful maple
      and ash woods, with their hundred autumn tints, all merging to one soft,
      red tone, the roar of the stream tumbling down the ravine from the
      heights, the air that braced the nerves&mdash;it all seemed to be part of
      her, the passion of life corresponding to the passion of living in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After watching the scene dreamily for a moment, she turned and laid the
      iron she had been using upon the hot stove near. Taking up another, she
      touched it with a moistened finger to test the heat, and, leaning above
      the table again, passed it over the linen for a few moments, smiling at
      something that was in her mind. Presently she held the petticoat up,
      turned it round, then hung it in front of her, eyeing it with critical
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; she said, nodding at it. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be seen, I suppose, but
      I&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re nice enough for a queen&mdash;and that&rsquo;s enough to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed a little, as though someone had heard her words and was
      looking at her, then she carefully laid the petticoat over the back of a
      chair. &ldquo;No queen&rsquo;s got one whiter, if I do say it,&rdquo; she continued, tossing
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that, at any rate, she was right, for the water of the mountain springs
      was pure, the air was clear, and the sun was clarifying; and little
      ornamented or frilled as it was, the petticoat was exquisitely soft and
      delicate. It would have appealed to more eyes than a woman&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; She nodded at it again and turned again to the bright world
      outside. With arms raised and hands resting against the timbers of the
      doorway, she stood dreaming. A flock of pigeons passed with a whir not far
      away, and skirted the woods making down the valley. She watched their
      flight abstractedly, yet with a subconscious sense of pleasure. Life&mdash;they
      were Life, eager, buoyant, belonging to this wild region, where still the
      heart could feel so much at home, where the great world was missed so
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as she gazed, a shot rang out down the valley, and two of the
      pigeons came tumbling to the ground, a stray feather floating after. With
      a startled exclamation she took a step forward. Her brain became confused
      and disturbed. She had looked out on Eden, and it had been ravaged before
      her eyes. She had been thinking of to-morrow, and this vast prospect of
      beauty and serenity had been part of the pageant in which it moved. Not
      the valley alone had been marauded, but that &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; and all it meant
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the valley had become clouded over for her, its glory and its
      grace despoiled. She turned back to the room where the white petticoat lay
      upon the chair, but stopped with a little cry of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was standing in the centre of the room. He had entered stealthily by
      the back door, and had waited for her to turn round. He was haggard and
      travel stained, and there was a feverish light in his eyes. His fingers
      trembled as they adjusted his belt, which seemed too large for him.
      Mechanically he buckled it tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jenny Long, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I beg pardon for sneakin&rsquo; in
      like this, but they&rsquo;re after me, some ranchers and a constable&mdash;one
      o&rsquo; the Riders of the Plains. I&rsquo;ve been tryin&rsquo; to make this house all day.
      You&rsquo;re Jenny Long, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had plenty of courage, and, after the first instant of shock, she had
      herself in hand. She had quickly observed his condition, had marked the
      candour of the eye and the decision and character of the face, and doubt
      of him found no place in her mind. She had the keen observation of the
      dweller in lonely places, where every traveller has the potentialities of
      a foe, while the door of hospitality is opened to him after the custom of
      the wilds. Year in, year out, since she was a little girl and came to live
      here with her Uncle Sanger when her father died&mdash;her mother had gone
      before she could speak&mdash;travellers had halted at this door, going
      North or coming South, had had bite and sup, and bed, may be, and had
      passed on, most of them never to be seen again. More than that, too, there
      had been moments of peril, such as when, alone, she had faced two
      wood-thieves with a revolver, as they were taking her mountain-pony with
      them, and herself had made them &ldquo;hands-up,&rdquo; and had marched them into a
      prospector&rsquo;s camp five miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no doubt about the man before her. Whatever he had done, it was
      nothing dirty or mean&mdash;of that she was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Jenny Long,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;What have you done? What are they
      after you for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to-morrow,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to-morrow I got to git to Bindon. It&rsquo;s life
      or death. I come from prospecting two hundred miles up North. I done it in
      two days and a half. My horse dropped dead&mdash;I&rsquo;m near dead myself. I
      tried to borrow another horse up at Clancey&rsquo;s, and at Scotton&rsquo;s Drive, but
      they didn&rsquo;t know me, and they bounced me. So I borrowed a horse off
      Weigall&rsquo;s paddock, to make for here&mdash;to you. I didn&rsquo;t mean to keep
      that horse. Hell, I&rsquo;m no horse-stealer! But I couldn&rsquo;t explain to them,
      except that I had to git to Bindon to save a man&rsquo;s life. If people laugh
      in your face, it&rsquo;s no use explainin&rsquo;. I took a roan from Weigall&rsquo;s, and
      they got after me. &lsquo;Bout six miles up they shot at me an&rsquo; hurt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw that one arm hung limp at his side and that his wrist was wound
      with a red bandana.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started forward. &ldquo;Are you hurt bad? Can I bind it up or wash it for
      you? I&rsquo;ve got plenty of hot water here, and it&rsquo;s bad letting a wound get
      stale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I washed the hole clean in the creek below. I doubled
      on them. I had to go down past your place here, and then work back to be
      rid of them. But there&rsquo;s no telling when they&rsquo;ll drop on to the game, and
      come back for me. My only chance was to git to you. Even if I had a horse,
      I couldn&rsquo;t make Bindon in time. It&rsquo;s two days round the gorge by trail. A
      horse is no use now&mdash;I lost too much time since last night. I can&rsquo;t
      git to Bindon to-morrow in time, if I ride the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The river?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way. It cuts off fifty mile. That&rsquo;s why I come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She frowned a little, her face became troubled, and her glance fell on his
      arm nervously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ve I got to do with it?&rdquo; she asked almost sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if this was all right,&rdquo;&mdash;he touched the wounded arm&mdash;&ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t take the rapids in a canoe. I don&rsquo;t know them, an&rsquo; it would be
      sure death. That&rsquo;s not the worst, for there&rsquo;s a man at Bindon would lose
      his life&mdash;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps twenty men&mdash;I dunno; but one man sure.
      To-morrow, it&rsquo;s go or stay with him. He was good&mdash;Lord, but he was
      good!&mdash;to my little gal years back. She&rsquo;d only been married to me a
      year when he saved her, riskin&rsquo; his own life. No one else had the pluck.
      My little gal, only twenty she was, an&rsquo; pretty as a picture, an&rsquo; me fifty
      miles away when the fire broke out in the hotel where she was. He&rsquo;d have
      gone down to hell for a friend, an&rsquo; he saved my little gal. I had her for
      five years after that. That&rsquo;s why I got to git to Bindon to-morrow. If I
      don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want to see to-morrow. I got to go down the river
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew what he was going to ask her. She knew he was thinking what all
      the North knew, that she was the first person to take the Dog Nose Rapids
      in a canoe, down the great river scarce a stone&rsquo;s-throw from her door; and
      that she had done it in safety many times. Not in all the West and North
      were there a half-dozen people who could take a canoe to Bindon, and they
      were not here. She knew that he meant to ask her to paddle him down the
      swift stream with its murderous rocks, to Bindon. She glanced at the white
      petticoat on the chair, and her lips tightened. To-morrow-tomorrow was as
      much to her here as it would be to this man before her, or the man he
      would save at Bindon. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked, hardening her heart.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see? I want you to hide me here till tonight. There&rsquo;s a full
      moon, an&rsquo; it would be as plain goin&rsquo; as by day. They told me about you up
      North, and I said to myself, &lsquo;If I git to Jenny Long, an&rsquo; tell her about
      my friend at Bindon, an&rsquo; my little gal, she&rsquo;ll take me down to Bindon in
      time.&rsquo; My little gal would have paid her own debt if she&rsquo;d ever had the
      chance. She didn&rsquo;t&mdash;she&rsquo;s lying up on Mazy Mountain. But one woman&rsquo;ll
      do a lot for the sake of another woman. Say, you&rsquo;ll do it, won&rsquo;t you? If I
      don&rsquo;t git there by to-morrow noon, it&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not answer. He was asking more than he knew. Why should she be
      sacrificed? Was it her duty to pay the &ldquo;little gal&rsquo;s debt,&rdquo; to save the
      man at Bindon? To-morrow was to be the great day in her own life. The one
      man in all the world was coming to marry her to-morrow. After four years&rsquo; 
      waiting, after a bitter quarrel in which both had been to blame, he was
      coming from the mining town of Selby to marry her to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen? Why will your friend lose his life if you don&rsquo;t get to
      Bindon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By noon to-morrow, by twelve o&rsquo;clock noon; that&rsquo;s the plot; that&rsquo;s what
      they&rsquo;ve schemed. Three days ago, I heard. I got a man free from trouble
      North&mdash;he was no good, but I thought he ought to have another chance,
      and I got him free. He told me of what was to be done at Bindon. There&rsquo;d
      been a strike in the mine, an&rsquo; my friend had took it in hand with
      knuckle-dusters on. He isn&rsquo;t the kind to fell a tree with a jack-knife.
      Then three of the strikers that had been turned away&mdash;they was the
      ringleaders&mdash;they laid a plan that&rsquo;d make the devil sick. They&rsquo;ve put
      a machine in the mine, an&rsquo; timed it, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll go off when my friend comes
      out of the mine at noon to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face was pale now, and her eyes had a look of pain and horror. Her man&mdash;him
      that she was to marry&mdash;was the head of a mine also at Selby, forty
      miles beyond Bindon, and the horrible plot came home to her with piercing
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a second&rsquo;s warning,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;to go like that, the man that was
      so good to my little gal, an&rsquo; me with a chance to save him, an&rsquo; others
      too, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps. You won&rsquo;t let it be. Say, I&rsquo;m pinnin&rsquo; my faith to you. I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he swayed. She caught him, held him, and lowered him gently in a
      chair. Presently he opened his eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s want o&rsquo; food, I suppose,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a bit of bread and meat&mdash;I must keep up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to a cupboard, but suddenly turned towards him again. Her ears
      had caught a sound outside in the underbush. He had heard also, and he
      half staggered to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick-in here!&rdquo; she said, and, opening a door, pushed him inside. &ldquo;Lie
      down on my bed, and I&rsquo;ll bring you vittles as quick as I can,&rdquo; she added.
      Then she shut the door, turned to the ironing-board, and took up the iron,
      as the figure of a man darkened the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jinny, fixin&rsquo; up for to-morrow?&rdquo; the man said, stepping inside,
      with a rifle under his arm and some pigeons in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and gave him an impatient, scrutinising glance. His face had a
      fatuous kind of smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been celebrating the pigeons?&rdquo; she asked drily, jerking her head towards
      the two birds, which she had seen drop from her Eden skies a short time
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only had one swig of whiskey, honest Injun!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I
      might have waited till to-morrow, but I was dead-beat. I got a bear over
      by the Tenmile Reach, and I was tired. I ain&rsquo;t so young as I used to be,
      and, anyhow, what&rsquo;s the good! What&rsquo;s ahead of me? You&rsquo;re going to git
      married to-morrow after all these years we bin together, and you&rsquo;re going
      down to Selby from the mountains, where I won&rsquo;t see you, not once in a
      blue moon. Only that old trollop, Mother Massy, to look after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to Selby and live there. You&rsquo;ll be welcome by Jake and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood his gun in the corner and, swinging the pigeons in his hand,
      said: &ldquo;Me live out of the mountains? Don&rsquo;t you know better than that? I
      couldn&rsquo;t breathe; and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to breathe. I&rsquo;ve got my shack here,
      I got my fur business, and they&rsquo;re still fond of whiskey up North!&rdquo; He
      chuckled to himself, as he thought of the illicit still farther up the
      mountain behind them. &ldquo;I make enough to live on, and I&rsquo;ve put a few
      dollars by, though I won&rsquo;t have so many after to-morrow, after I&rsquo;ve given
      you a little pile, Jinny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps there won&rsquo;t be any to-morrow, as you expect,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man started. &ldquo;What, you and Jake ain&rsquo;t quarrelled again? You ain&rsquo;t
      broke it off at the last moment, same as before? You ain&rsquo;t had a letter
      from Jake?&rdquo; He looked at the white petticoat on the chairback, and shook
      his head in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no letter,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no letter from Selby for a
      month. It was all settled then, and there was no good writing, when he was
      coming to-morrow with the minister and the licence. Who do you think&rsquo;d be
      postman from Selby here? It must have cost him ten dollars to send the
      last letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the matter? I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; the old man urged
      querulously. He did not want her to marry and leave him, but he wanted no
      more troubles; he did not relish being asked awkward questions by every
      mountaineer he met, as to why Jenny Long didn&rsquo;t marry Jake Lawson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way that I can be married tomorrow,&rdquo; she said at last,
      &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s by you taking a man down the Dog Nose Rapids to Bindon
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the pigeons on the floor, dumbfounded. &ldquo;What in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, in sheer incapacity, to go further. Jenny had not always
      been easy to understand, but she was wholly incomprehensible now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up the pigeons and was about to speak, but she glanced at the
      bedroom door, where her exhausted visitor had stretched himself on her
      bed, and beckoned her uncle to another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a plate of vittles ready for you in there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
      you as you eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her into the little living-room adorned by the trophies of his
      earlier achievements with gun and rifle, and sat down at the table, where
      some food lay covered by a clean white cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one&rsquo;ll ever look after me as you&rsquo;ve done, Jinny,&rdquo; he said, as he
      lifted the cloth and saw the palatable dish ready for him. Then he
      remembered again about to-morrow and the Dog Nose Rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, Jinny? What&rsquo;s that about my canoeing a man down to
      Bindon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat, uncle,&rdquo; she said more softly than she had yet spoken, for his words
      about her care of him had brought a moisture to her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in
      a minute and tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s about took away my appetite,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel a kind of
      sinking.&rdquo; He took from his pocket a bottle, poured some of its contents
      into a tin cup, and drank it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose you couldn&rsquo;t take a man down to Bindon,&rdquo; she said, as she
      saw his hand trembling on the cup. Then she turned and entered the other
      room again. Going to the cupboard, she hastily heaped a plate with food,
      and, taking a dipper of water from a pail near by, she entered her bedroom
      hastily and placed what she had brought on a small table, as her visitor
      rose slowly from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to speak, but she made a protesting gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you anything yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who was it come?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men after me may git here any minute,&rdquo; he urged anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d not be coming into my room,&rdquo; she answered, flushing slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hide me down by the river till we start?&rdquo; he asked, his eyes
      eagerly searching her face. He was assuming that she would take him down
      the river: but she gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see if he&rsquo;ll take you first,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;your uncle, Tom Sanger? He drinks, I&rsquo;ve heard. He&rsquo;d never git to
      Bindon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply directly to his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back and tell you.
      There&rsquo;s a place you could hide by the river where no one could ever find
      you,&rdquo; she said, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stepped out, she saw the old man standing in the doorway of the
      other room. His face was petrified with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who you got in that room, Jinny? What man you got in that room? I heard a
      man&rsquo;s voice. Is it because o&rsquo; him that you bin talkin&rsquo; about no weddin&rsquo; 
      to-morrow? Is it one o&rsquo; the others come back, puttin&rsquo; you off Jake again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed fire at his first words, and her breast heaved with
      anger, but suddenly she became composed again and motioned him to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You eat, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it, Uncle Tom,&rdquo; she said, and,
      seating herself at the table also, she told him the story of the man who
      must go to Bindon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished, the old man blinked at her for a minute without
      speaking, then he said slowly: &ldquo;I heard something &lsquo;bout trouble down at
      Bindon yisterday from a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay man goin&rsquo; North, but I didn&rsquo;t take it
      in. You&rsquo;ve got a lot o&rsquo; sense, Jinny, an&rsquo; if you think he&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; the
      truth, why, it goes; but it&rsquo;s as big a mixup as a lariat in a steer&rsquo;s
      horns. You&rsquo;ve got to hide him sure, whoever he is, for I wouldn&rsquo;t hand an
      Eskimo over, if I&rsquo;d taken him in my home once; we&rsquo;re mountain people. A
      man ought to be hung for horse-stealin&rsquo;, but this was different. He was
      doing it to save a man&rsquo;s life, an&rsquo; that man at Bindon was good to his
      little gal, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved his head from side to side with the air of a sentimental
      philosopher. He had all the vanity of a man who had been a success in a
      small, shrewd, culpable way&mdash;had he not evaded the law for thirty
      years with his whiskey-still?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how he felt,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;When Betsy died&mdash;we was only
      four years married&mdash;I could have crawled into a knot-hole an&rsquo; died
      there. You got to save him, Jinny, but&rdquo;&mdash;he came suddenly to his feet&mdash;&ldquo;he
      ain&rsquo;t safe here. They might come any minute, if they&rsquo;ve got back on his
      trail. I&rsquo;ll take him up the gorge. You know where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sit still, Uncle Tom,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Leave him where he is a minute.
      There&rsquo;s things must be settled first. They ain&rsquo;t going to look for him in
      my bedroom, be they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see &lsquo;em at it. You got a temper, Jinny;
      and you got a pistol too, eh?&rdquo; He chuckled again. &ldquo;As good a shot as any
      in the mountains. I can see you darin&rsquo; &lsquo;em to come on. But what if Jake
      come, and he found a man in your bedroom&rdquo;&mdash;he wiped the tears of
      laughter from his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;why, Jinny&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, for there was anger in her face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear
      any more of that. I do what I want to do,&rdquo; she snapped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, you always done what you wanted; but we got to git him up the
      hills, till it&rsquo;s sure they&rsquo;re out o&rsquo; the mountains and gone back. It&rsquo;ll be
      days, mebbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Tom, you&rsquo;ve took too much to drink,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      remember he&rsquo;s got to be at Bindon by to-morrow noon. He&rsquo;s got to save his
      friend by then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! Who&rsquo;s going to take him down the river to-night? You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
      be married to-morrow. If you like, you can give him the canoe. It&rsquo;ll never
      come back, nor him neither!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been down with me,&rdquo; she responded suggestively. &ldquo;And you went down
      once by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been so well this summer. My sight ain&rsquo;t what
      it was. I can&rsquo;t stand the racket as I once could. &lsquo;Pears to me I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; 
      old. No, I couldn&rsquo;t take them rapids, Jinny, not for one frozen minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with trouble in her eyes, and her face lost some of its
      colour. She was fighting back the inevitable, even as its shadow fell upon
      her. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want a man to die, if you could save him, Uncle Tom&mdash;blown
      up, sent to Kingdom Come without any warning at all; and perhaps he&rsquo;s got
      them that love him&mdash;and the world so beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t nice dyin&rsquo; in the summer, when it&rsquo;s all sun, and there&rsquo;s
      plenty everywhere; but there&rsquo;s no one to go down the river with him.
      What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her struggle was over. She had urged him, but in very truth she was urging
      herself all the time, bringing herself to the axe of sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Dingley. I&rsquo;m going down the river with him&mdash;down to
      Bindon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s mouth opened in blank amazement. His eyes blinked
      helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you talkin&rsquo; about, Jinny! Jake&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; up with the minister, an&rsquo; 
      you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be married at noon to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; him&rdquo;&mdash;she jerked her head towards the room where Dingley
      was&mdash;&ldquo;down Dog Nose Rapids to-night. He&rsquo;s risked his life for his
      friend, thinkin&rsquo; of her that&rsquo;s dead an&rsquo; gone, and a man&rsquo;s life is a man&rsquo;s
      life. If it was Jake&rsquo;s life in danger, what&rsquo;d I think of a woman that
      could save him, and didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onct you broke off with Jake Lawson&mdash;the day before you was to be
      married; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s took years to make up an&rsquo; agree again to be spliced. If
      Jake comes here to-morrow, and you ain&rsquo;t here, what do you think he&rsquo;ll do?
      The neighbours are comin&rsquo; for fifty miles round, two is comin&rsquo; up a
      hundred miles, an&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t&mdash;Jinny, you can&rsquo;t do it. I bin sick of
      answerin&rsquo; questions all these years &lsquo;bout you and Jake, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; 
      through it again. I&rsquo;ve told more lies than there&rsquo;s straws in a tick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flamed out. &ldquo;Then take him down the river yourself&mdash;a man to do a
      man&rsquo;s work. Are you afeard to take the risk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hands slowly and looked at them. They shook a little.
      &ldquo;Yes, Jinny,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard. I ain&rsquo;t what I was. I made a
      mistake, Jinny. I&rsquo;ve took too much whiskey. I&rsquo;m older than I ought to be.
      I oughtn&rsquo;t never to have had a whiskey-still, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t have drunk so
      much. I got money&mdash;money for you, Jinny, for you an&rsquo; Jake, but I&rsquo;ve
      lost what I&rsquo;ll never git back. I&rsquo;m afeard to go down the river with him.
      I&rsquo;d go smash in the Dog Nose Rapids. I got no nerve. I can&rsquo;t hunt the
      grizzly any more, nor the puma, Jinny. I got to keep to common shootin&rsquo;,
      now and henceforth, amen! No, I&rsquo;d go smash in Dog Nose Rapids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught his hands impulsively. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret, Uncle Tom. You&rsquo;ve bin a
      good uncle to me, and you&rsquo;ve bin a good friend, and you ain&rsquo;t the first
      that&rsquo;s found whiskey too much for him. You ain&rsquo;t got an enemy in the
      mountains. Why, I&rsquo;ve got two or three&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! Women&mdash;only women whose beaux left &lsquo;em to follow after you.
      That&rsquo;s nothing, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be your friends fast enough after you&rsquo;re
      married tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to be married to-morrow. I&rsquo;m going down to Bindon to-night.
      If Jake&rsquo;s mad, then it&rsquo;s all over, and there&rsquo;ll be more trouble among the
      women up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had entered the other room. The old man saw the white
      petticoat on the chair. &ldquo;No woman in the mountains ever had a petticoat
      like that, Jinny. It&rsquo;d make a dress, it&rsquo;s that pretty an&rsquo; neat. Golly, I&rsquo;d
      like to see it on you, with the blue skirt over, and just hitched up a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up&mdash;shut up!&rdquo; she said in sudden anger, and caught up the
      petticoat as though she would put it away; but presently she laid it down
      again and smoothed it with quick, nervous fingers. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you talk sense
      and leave my clothes alone? If Jake comes, and I&rsquo;m not here, and he wants
      to make a fuss, and spoil everything, and won&rsquo;t wait, you give him this
      petticoat. You put it in his arms. I bet you&rsquo;ll have the laugh on him.
      He&rsquo;s got a temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&rsquo;ve you, Jinny, dear, so&rsquo;ve you,&rdquo; said the old man, laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to have your own way, same as ever&mdash;same as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      A moon of exquisite whiteness silvering the world, making shadows on the
      water as though it were sunlight and the daytime, giving a spectral look
      to the endless array of poplar trees on the banks, glittering on the foam
      of the rapids. The spangling stars made the arch of the sky like some
      gorgeous chancel in a cathedral as vast as life and time. Like the day
      which was ended, in which the mountain-girl had found a taste of Eden, it
      seemed too sacred for mortal strife. Now and again there came the note of
      a night-bird, the croak of a frog from the shore; but the serene stillness
      and beauty of the primeval North was over all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours after sunset it had all been silent and brooding, and then
      two figures appeared on the bank of the great river. A canoe was softly
      and hastily pushed out from its hidden shelter under the overhanging bank,
      and was noiselessly paddled out to midstream, dropping down the current
      meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jenny Long and the man who must get to Bindon. They had waited till
      nine o&rsquo;clock, when the moon was high and full, to venture forth. Then
      Dingley had dropped from her bedroom window, had joined her under the
      trees, and they had sped away, while the man&rsquo;s hunters, who had come
      suddenly, and before Jenny could get him away into the woods, were
      carousing inside. These had tracked their man back to Tom Sanger&rsquo;s house,
      and at first they were incredulous that Jenny and her uncle had not seen
      him. They had prepared to search the house, and one had laid his finger on
      the latch of her bedroom door; but she had flared out with such anger
      that, mindful of the supper she had already begun to prepare for them,
      they had desisted, and the whiskey-jug which the old man brought out
      distracted their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of their number, known as the Man from Clancey&rsquo;s, had, however, been
      outside when Dingley had dropped from the window, and had seen him from a
      distance. He had not given the alarm, but had followed, to make the
      capture by himself. But Jenny had heard the stir of life behind them, and
      had made a sharp detour, so that they had reached the shore and were out
      in mid-stream before their tracker got to the river. Then he called to
      them to return, but Jenny only bent a little lower and paddled on, guiding
      the canoe towards the safe channel through the first small rapids leading
      to the great Dog Nose Rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rifle-shot rang out, and a bullet &ldquo;pinged&rdquo; over the water and splintered
      the side of the canoe where Dingley sat. He looked calmly back, and saw
      the rifle raised again, but did not stir, in spite of Jenny&rsquo;s warning to
      lie down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not fire on you so long as he can draw a bead on me,&rdquo; he said
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a shot rang out, and the bullet sang past his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he hits me, you go straight on to Bindon,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Never mind
      about me. Go to the Snowdrop Mine. Get there by twelve o&rsquo;clock, and warn
      them. Don&rsquo;t stop a second for me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly three shots rang out in succession&mdash;Tom Sanger&rsquo;s house had
      emptied itself on the bank of the river&mdash;and Dingley gave a sharp
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve hit me, but it&rsquo;s the same arm as before,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;They got
      no right to fire at me. It&rsquo;s not the law. Don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; he added quickly,
      as he saw her half turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there were loud voices on the shore. Old Tom Sanger was threatening to
      shoot the first man that fired again, and he would have kept his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who you firin&rsquo; at?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my niece, Jinny Long, an&rsquo; you let
      that boat alone. This ain&rsquo;t the land o&rsquo; lynch law. Dingley ain&rsquo;t escaped
      from gaol. You got no right to fire at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever went down Dog Nose Rapids at night,&rdquo; said the Man from
      Clancey&rsquo;s, whose shot had got Dingley&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a chance of them
      doing it. No one&rsquo;s ever done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were in the roaring rapids now, and the canoe was jumping through
      the foam like a racehorse. The keen eyes on the bank watched the canoe
      till it was lost in the half-gloom below the first rapids, and then they
      went slowly back to Tom Sanger&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there&rsquo;ll be no wedding to-morrow,&rdquo; said the Man from Clancey&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funerals, more likely,&rdquo; drawled another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jinny Long&rsquo;s in that canoe, an&rsquo; she ginerally does what she wants to,&rdquo;
       said Tom Sanger sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we done our best, and now I hope they&rsquo;ll get to Bindon,&rdquo; said
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanger passed the jug to him freely. Then they sat down and talked of the
      people who had been drowned in Dog Nose Rapids and of the last wedding in
      the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as the Man from Clancey&rsquo;s had said, no one had ever gone down Dog
      Nose Rapids in the nighttime, and probably no one but Jenny Long would
      have ventured it. Dingley had had no idea what a perilous task had been
      set his rescuer. It was only when the angry roar of the great rapids
      floated up-stream to them, increasing in volume till they could see the
      terror of tumbling waters just below, and the canoe shot forward like a
      snake through the swift, smooth current which would sweep them into the
      vast caldron, that he realised the terrible hazard of the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was directly overhead when they drew upon the race of rocks and
      fighting water and foam. On either side only the shadowed shore, forsaken
      by the races which had hunted and roamed and ravaged here&mdash;not a
      light, nor any sign of life, or the friendliness of human presence to make
      their isolation less complete, their danger, as it were, shared by
      fellow-mortals. Bright as the moon was, it was not bright enough for
      perfect pilotage. Never in the history of white men had these rapids been
      ridden at nighttime. As they sped down the flume of the deep, irresistible
      current, and were launched into the trouble of rocks and water, Jenny
      realised how great their peril was, and how different the track of the
      waters looked at nighttime from daytime. Outlines seemed merged, rocks did
      not look the same, whirlpools had a different vortex, islands of stone had
      a new configuration. As they sped on, lurching, jumping, piercing a broken
      wall of wave and spray like a torpedo, shooting an almost sheer fall, she
      came to rely on a sense of intuition rather than memory, for night had
      transformed the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound escaped either. The man kept his eyes fixed on the woman; the
      woman scanned the dreadful pathway with eyes deep-set and burning,
      resolute, vigilant, and yet defiant too, as though she had been trapped
      into this track of danger, and was fighting without great hope, but with
      the temerity and nonchalance of despair. Her arms were bare to the
      shoulder almost, and her face was again and again drenched; but second
      succeeded second, minute followed minute in a struggle which might well
      turn a man&rsquo;s hair grey, and now, at last-how many hours was it since they
      had been cast into this den of roaring waters!&mdash;at last, suddenly,
      over a large fall, and here smooth waters again, smooth and untroubled,
      and strong and deep. Then, and only then, did a word escape either; but
      the man had passed through torture and unavailing regret, for he realised
      that he had had no right to bring this girl into such a fight. It was not
      her friend who was in danger at Bindon. Her life had been risked without
      due warrant. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have asked it,&rdquo; he said in a
      low voice. &ldquo;Lord, but you are a wonder&mdash;to take that hurdle for no
      one that belonged to you, and to do it as you&rsquo;ve done it. This country
      will rise to you.&rdquo; He looked back on the raging rapids far behind, and he
      shuddered. &ldquo;It was a close call, and no mistake. We must have been within
      a foot of down-you-go fifty times. But it&rsquo;s all right now, if we can last
      it out and git there.&rdquo; Again he glanced back, then turned to the girl. &ldquo;It
      makes me pretty sick to look at it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I bin through a lot,
      but that&rsquo;s as sharp practice as I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here and let me bind up your arm,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;They hit you&mdash;the
      sneaks! Are you bleeding much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came near her carefully, as she got the big canoe out of the current
      into quieter water. She whipped the scarf from about her neck, and with
      his knife ripped up the seam of his sleeve. Her face was alive with the
      joy of conflict and elated with triumph. Her eyes were shining. She bathed
      the wound&mdash;the bullet had passed clean through the fleshy part of the
      arm&mdash;and then carefully tied the scarf round it over her
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s as good as a man could do it,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good as any doctor,&rdquo; he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking of your arm,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Course not. Excuse me. You was talkin&rsquo; of them rapids, and I&rsquo;ve got to
      say there ain&rsquo;t a man that could have done it and come through like you. I
      guess the man that marries you&rsquo;ll get more than his share of luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want none of that,&rdquo; she said sharply, and picked up her paddle again,
      her eyes flashing anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a pistol from his pocket and offered it to her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any
      harm by what I said. Take this if you think I won&rsquo;t know how to behave
      myself,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung up her head a little. &ldquo;I knew what I was doing before I
      started,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Put it away. How far is it, and can we do it in
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can hold out, we can do it; but it means going all night and all
      morning; and it ain&rsquo;t dawn yet, by a long shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dawn came at last, and the mist of early morning, and the imperious and
      dispelling sun; and with mouthfuls of food as they drifted on, the two
      fixed their eyes on the horizon beyond which lay Bindon. And now it seemed
      to the girl as though this race to save a life or many lives was the one
      thing in existence. To-morrow was to-day, and the white petticoat was
      lying in the little house in the mountains, and her wedding was an
      interminable distance off, so had this adventure drawn her into its risks
      and toils and haggard exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight, nine, ten, eleven o&rsquo;clock came, and then they saw signs of
      settlement. Houses appeared here and there upon the banks, and now and
      then a horseman watched them from the shore, but they could not pause.
      Bindon&mdash;Bindon&mdash;Bindon&mdash;the Snowdrop Mine at Bindon, and a
      death-dealing machine timed to do its deadly work, were before the eyes of
      the two voyageurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past eleven, and the town of Bindon was just beyond them. A quarter
      to twelve, and they had run their canoe into the bank beyond which were
      the smokestacks and chimneys of the mine. Bindon was peacefully pursuing
      its way, though here and there were little groups of strikers who had not
      resumed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dingley and the girl scrambled up the bank. Trembling with fatigue, they
      hastened on. The man drew ahead of her, for she had paddled for fifteen
      hours, practically without ceasing, and the ground seemed to rise up at
      her. But she would not let him stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried on, reached the mine, and entered, shouting the name of his
      friend. It was seven minutes to twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, a half-dozen men came rushing from that portion of the
      mine where Dingley had been told the machine was placed, and at their head
      was Lawson, the man he had come to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl hastened on to meet them, but she grew faint and leaned against a
      tree, scarce conscious. She was roused by voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t me, it wasn&rsquo;t me that done it; it was a girl. Here she is&mdash;Jenny
      Long! You got to thank her, Jake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jake! Jake! The girl awakened to full understanding now. Jake&mdash;what
      Jake? She looked, then stumbled forward with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jake&mdash;it was my Jake!&rdquo; she faltered. The mine-boss caught her in his
      arms. &ldquo;You, Jenny! It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s saved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a rumble as of thunder, and a cloud of dust and stone
      rose from the Snowdrop Mine. The mine-boss tightened his arm round the
      girl&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I missed, through him and you, Jenny,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was you doing here, and not at Selby, Jake?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sent for me-to stop the trouble here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about our wedding to-day?&rdquo; she asked with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man went from here with a letter to you three days ago,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;asking you to come down here and be married. I suppose he got drunk, or
      had an accident, and didn&rsquo;t reach you. It had to be. I was needed here&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      tell what would happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has happened out all right,&rdquo; said Dingley, &ldquo;and this&rsquo;ll be the end of
      it. You got them miners solid now. The strikers&rsquo;ll eat humble pie after
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be married to-day, just the same,&rdquo; the mine-boss said, as he gave
      some brandy to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl shook her head. She was thinking of a white petticoat in a
      little house in the mountains. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be married to-day,&rdquo; she
      said decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to-morrow,&rdquo; said the mine-boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl shook her head again. &ldquo;To-day is tomorrow,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;You can wait, Jake. I&rsquo;m going back home to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m white; I&rsquo;m not an Indian. My father was a white man. I&rsquo;ve been
      brought up as a white girl. I&rsquo;ve had a white girl&rsquo;s schooling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed as she sprang to her feet and walked up and down the room
      for a moment, then stood still, facing her mother,&mdash;a dark-faced,
      pock-marked woman, with heavy, somnolent eyes, and waited for her to
      speak. The reply came slowly and sullenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Blackfoot woman. I lived on the Muskwat River among the braves for
      thirty years. I have killed buffalo. I have seen battles. Men, too, I have
      killed when they came to steal our horses and crept in on our lodges in
      the night-the Crees! I am a Blackfoot. You are the daughter of a Blackfoot
      woman. No medicine can cure that. Sit down. You have no sense. You are not
      white. They will not have you. Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s handsome face flushed; she threw up her hands in an agony of
      protest. A dreadful anger was in her panting breast, but she could not
      speak. She seemed to choke with excess of feeling. For an instant she
      stood still, trembling with agitation, then she sat down suddenly on a
      great couch covered with soft deerskins and buffalo robes. There was deep
      in her the habit of obedience to this sombre but striking woman. She had
      been ruled firmly, almost oppressively, and she had not yet revolted.
      Seated on the couch, she gazed out of the window at the flying snow, her
      brain too much on fire for thought, passion beating like a pulse in all
      her lithe and graceful young body, which had known the storms of life and
      time for only twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind shrieked and the snow swept past in clouds of blinding drift,
      completely hiding from sight the town below them, whose civilisation had
      built itself many habitations and was making roads and streets on the
      green-brown plain, where herds of buffalo had stamped and streamed and
      thundered not long ago. The town was a mile and a half away, and these two
      were alone in a great circle of storm, one of them battling against a
      tempest which might yet overtake her, against which she had set her face
      ever since she could remember, though it had only come to violence since
      her father died two years before&mdash;a careless, strong, wilful white
      man, who had lived the Indian life for many years, but had been swallowed
      at last by the great wave of civilisation streaming westward and
      northward, wiping out the game and the Indian, and overwhelming the rough,
      fighting, hunting, pioneer life. Joel Renton had made money, by good luck
      chiefly, having held land here and there which he had got for nothing, and
      had then almost forgotten about it, and, when reminded of it, still held
      on to it with that defiant stubbornness which often possesses improvident
      and careless natures. He had never had any real business instinct, and to
      swagger a little over the land he held and to treat offers of purchase
      with contempt was the loud assertion of a capacity he did not possess. So
      it was that stubborn vanity, beneath which was his angry protest against
      the prejudice felt by the new people of the West for the white pioneer who
      married an Indian, and lived the Indian life,&mdash;so it was that this
      gave him competence and a comfortable home after the old trader had been
      driven out by the railway and the shopkeeper. With the first land he sold
      he sent his daughter away to school in a town farther east and south,
      where she had been brought in touch with a life that at once cramped and
      attracted her; where, too, she had felt the first chill of racial
      ostracism, and had proudly fought it to the end, her weapons being talent,
      industry, and a hot, defiant ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been three years of bitter, almost half-sullen, struggle,
      lightened by one sweet friendship with a girl whose face she had since
      drawn in a hundred different poses on stray pieces of paper, on the walls
      of the big, well-lighted attic to which she retreated for hours every day,
      when she was not abroad on the prairies, riding the Indian pony that her
      uncle the Piegan Chief, Ice Breaker, had given her years before. Three
      years of struggle, and then her father had died, and the refuge for her
      vexed, defiant heart was gone. While he lived she could affirm the rights
      of a white man&rsquo;s daughter, the rights of the daughter of a pioneer who had
      helped to make the West; and her pride in him had given a glow to her
      cheek and a spring to her step which drew every eye. In the chief street
      of Portage la Drome men would stop their trafficking and women nudge each
      other when she passed, and wherever she went she stirred interest, excited
      admiration, or aroused prejudice&mdash;but the prejudice did not matter so
      long as her father, Joel Renton, lived. Whatever his faults, and they were
      many&mdash;sometimes he drank too much, and swore a great deal, and
      bullied and stormed&mdash;she blinked at them all, for he was of the
      conquering race, a white man who had slept in white sheets and eaten off
      white tablecloths, and used a knife and fork, since he was born; and the
      women of his people had had soft petticoats and fine stockings, and silk
      gowns for festal days, and feathered hats of velvet, and shoes of polished
      leather, always and always, back through many generations. She had held
      her head high, for she was of his women, of the women of his people, with
      all their rights and all their claims. She had held it high till that
      stormy day&mdash;just such a day as this, with the surf of snow breaking
      against the house&mdash;when they carried him in out of the wild turmoil
      and snow, laying him on the couch where she now sat, and her head fell on
      his lifeless breast, and she cried out to him in vain to come back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the world her head was still held high, but in the attic-room, and
      out on the prairies far away, where only the coyote or the prairie-hen
      saw, her head drooped, and her eyes grew heavy with pain and sombre
      protest. Once in an agony of loneliness, and cruelly hurt by a conspicuous
      slight put upon her at the Portage by the wife of the Reeve of the town,
      who had daughters twain of pure white blood got from behind the bar of a
      saloon in Winnipeg, she had thrown open her window at night with the frost
      below zero, and stood in her thin nightdress, craving the death which she
      hoped the cold would give her soon. It had not availed, however, and once
      again she had ridden out in a blizzard to die, but had come upon a man
      lost in the snow, and her own misery had passed from her, and her heart,
      full of the blood of plainsmen, had done for another what it would not do
      for itself. The Indian in her had, with strange, sure instinct, found its
      way to Portage la Drome, the man with both hands and one foot frozen, on
      her pony, she walking at his side, only conscious that she had saved one,
      not two, lives that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was another such day, here again was the storm in her heart which had
      driven her into the plains that other time, and here again was that
      tempest of white death outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no sense. You are not white. They will not have you. Sit down&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had fallen on her ears with a cold, deadly smother. There came a
      chill upon her which stilled the wild pulses in her, which suddenly robbed
      the eyes of their brightness and gave a drawn look to the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not white. They will not have you, Pauline.&rdquo; The Indian mother
      repeated the words after a moment, her eyes grown still more gloomy; for
      in her, too, there was a dark tide of passion moving. In all the outlived
      years this girl had ever turned to the white father rather than to her,
      and she had been left more and more alone. Her man had been kind to her,
      and she had been a faithful wife, but she had resented the natural
      instinct of her half-breed child, almost white herself and with the
      feelings and ways of the whites, to turn always to her father, as though
      to a superior guide, to a higher influence and authority. Was not she
      herself the descendant of Blackfoot and Piegan chiefs through generations
      of rulers and warriors? Was there not Piegan and Blackfoot blood in the
      girl&rsquo;s veins? Must only the white man&rsquo;s blood be reckoned when they made
      up their daily account and balanced the books of their lives, credit and
      debtor,&mdash;misunderstanding and kind act, neglect and tenderness,
      reproof and praise, gentleness and impulse, anger and caress,&mdash;to be
      set down in the everlasting record? Why must the Indian always give way&mdash;Indian
      habits, Indian desires, the Indian way of doing things, the Indian point
      of view, Indian food, Indian medicine? Was it all bad, and only that which
      belonged to white life good?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at your face in the glass, Pauline,&rdquo; she added at last. &ldquo;You are
      good-looking, but it isn&rsquo;t the good looks of the whites. The lodge of a
      chieftainess is the place for you. There you would have praise and honour;
      among the whites you are only a half-breed. What is the good? Let us go
      back to the life out there beyond the Muskwat River&mdash;up beyond. There
      is hunting still, a little, and the world is quiet, and nothing troubles.
      Only the wild dog barks at night, or the wolf sniffs at the door and all
      day there is singing. Somewhere out beyond the Muskwat the feasts go on,
      and the old men build the great fires, and tell tales, and call the wind
      out of the north, and make the thunder speak; and the young men ride to
      the hunt or go out to battle, and build lodges for the daughters of the
      tribe; and each man has his woman, and each woman has in her breast the
      honour of the tribe, and the little ones fill the lodge with laughter.
      Like a pocket of deerskin is every house, warm and small and full of good
      things. Hai-yai, what is this life to that! There you will be head and
      chief of all, for there is money enough for a thousand horses; and your
      father was a white man, and these are the days when the white man rules.
      Like clouds before the sun are the races of men, and one race rises and
      another falls. Here you are not first, but last; and the child of the
      white father and mother, though they be as the dirt that flies from a
      horse&rsquo;s heels, it is before you. Your mother is a Blackfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the woman spoke slowly and with many pauses, the girl&rsquo;s mood changed,
      and there came into her eyes a strange, dark look deeper than anger. She
      listened with a sudden patience which stilled the agitation in her breast
      and gave a little touch of rigidity to her figure. Her eyes withdrew from
      the wild storm without and gravely settled on her mother&rsquo;s face, and with
      the Indian woman&rsquo;s last words understanding pierced, but did not dispel,
      the sombre and ominous look in her eyes. There was silence for a moment,
      and then she spoke almost as evenly as her mother had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you everything. You are my mother, and I love you; but you
      will not see the truth. When my father took you from the lodges and
      brought you here, it was the end of the Indian life. It was for you to go
      on with him, but you would not go. I was young, but I saw, and I said that
      in all things I would go with him. I did not know that it would be hard,
      but at school, at the very first, I began to understand. There was only
      one, a French girl&mdash;I loved her&mdash;a girl who said to me, &lsquo;You are
      as white as I am, as anyone, and your heart is the same, and you are
      beautiful.&rsquo; Yes, Manette said I was beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, a misty, far-away look came into her eyes, her
      fingers clasped and unclasped, and she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her brother, Julien,&mdash;he was older,&mdash;when he came to visit
      Manette, he spoke to me as though I was all white, and was good to me. I
      have never forgotten, never. It was five years ago, but I remember him. He
      was tall and strong, and as good as Manette&mdash;as good as Manette. I
      loved Manette, but she suffered for me, for I was not like the others, and
      my ways were different&mdash;then. I had lived up there on the Warais
      among the lodges, and I had not seen things&mdash;only from my father, and
      he did so much in an Indian way. So I was sick at heart, and sometimes I
      wanted to die; and once&mdash;But there was Manette, and she would laugh
      and sing, and we would play together, and I would speak French and she
      would speak English, and I learned from her to forget the Indian ways.
      What were they to me? I had loved them when I was of them, but I came on
      to a better life. The Indian life is to the white life as the parfleche
      pouch to&mdash;to this.&rdquo; She laid her hand upon a purse of delicate silver
      mesh hanging at her waist. &ldquo;When your eyes are opened you must go on, you
      cannot stop. There is no going back. When you have read of all there is in
      the white man&rsquo;s world, when you have seen, then there is no returning. You
      may end it all, if you wish, in the snow, in the river, but there is no
      returning. The lodge of a chief&mdash;ah, if my father had heard you say
      that&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian woman shifted heavily in her chair, then shrank away from the
      look fixed on her. Once or twice she made as if she would speak, but sank
      down in the great chair, helpless and dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lodge of a chief!&rdquo; the girl continued in a low, bitter voice. &ldquo;What
      is the lodge of a chief? A smoky fire, a pot, a bed of skins, aih-yi! If
      the lodges of the Indians were millions, and I could be head of all, and
      rule the land, yet would I rather be a white girl in the hut of her white
      man, struggling for daily bread among the people who sweep the buffalo
      out, but open up the land with the plough, and make a thousand live where
      one lived before. It is peace you want, my mother, peace and solitude, in
      which the soul goes to sleep. Your days of hope are over, and you want to
      drowse by the fire. I want to see the white men&rsquo;s cities grow, and the
      armies coming over the hill with the ploughs and the reapers and the
      mowers, and the wheels and the belts and engines of the great factories,
      and the white woman&rsquo;s life spreading everywhere; for I am a white man&rsquo;s
      daughter. I can&rsquo;t be both Indian and white. I will not be like the sun
      when the shadow cuts across it and the land grows dark. I will not be
      half-breed. I will be white or I will be Indian; and I will be white,
      white only. My heart is white, my tongue is white, I think, I feel, as
      white people think and feel. What they wish, I wish; as they live, I live;
      as white women dress, I dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She involuntarily drew up the dark red skirt she wore, showing a white
      petticoat and a pair of fine stockings on an ankle as shapely as she had
      ever seen among all the white women she knew. She drew herself up with
      pride, and her body had a grace and ease which the white woman&rsquo;s
      convention had not cramped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, with all her protests, no one would have thought her English. She
      might have been Spanish, or Italian, or Roumanian, or Slav, though nothing
      of her Indian blood showed in purely Indian characteristics, and something
      sparkled in her, gave a radiance to her face and figure which the storm
      and struggle in her did not smother. The white women of Portage la Drome
      were too blind, too prejudiced, to see all that she really was, and
      admiring white men could do little, for Pauline would have nothing to do
      with them till the women met her absolutely as an equal; and from the
      other halfbreeds, who intermarried with each other and were content to
      take a lower place than the pure whites, she held aloof, save when any of
      them was ill or in trouble. Then she recognised the claim of race, and
      came to their doors with pity and soft impulses to help them. French and
      Scotch and English half-breeds, as they were, they understood how she was
      making a fight for all who were half-Indian, half-white, and watched her
      with a furtive devotion, acknowledging her superior place, and proud of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not stay here,&rdquo; said the Indian mother with sullen stubbornness.
      &ldquo;I will go back beyond the Warais. My life is my own life, and I will do
      what I like with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl started, but became composed again on the instant. &ldquo;Is your life
      all your own, mother?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I did not come into the world of my own
      will. If I had I would have come all white or all Indian. I am your
      daughter, and I am here, good or bad&mdash;is your life all your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can marry and stay here, when I go. You are twenty. I had my man,
      your father, when I was seventeen. You can marry. There are men. You have
      money. They will marry you&mdash;and forget the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a cry of rage and misery the girl sprang to her feet and started
      forwards, but stopped suddenly at sound of a hasty knocking and a voice
      asking admittance. An instant later, a huge, bearded, broad-shouldered man
      stepped inside, shaking himself free of the snow, laughing half-sheepishly
      as he did so, and laying his fur-cap and gloves with exaggerated care on
      the wide window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Alloway,&rdquo; said the Indian woman in a voice of welcome, and with a
      brightening eye, for it would seem as though he came in answer to her
      words of a few moments before. With a mother&rsquo;s instinct she had divined at
      once the reason for the visit, though no warning thought crossed the mind
      of the girl, who placed a chair for their visitor with a heartiness which
      was real&mdash;was not this the white man she had saved from death in the
      snow a year ago? Her heart was soft towards the life she had kept in the
      world. She smiled at him, all the anger gone from her eyes, and there was
      almost a touch of tender anxiety in her voice as she said &ldquo;What brought
      you out in this blizzard? It wasn&rsquo;t safe. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible you got
      here from the Portage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The huge ranchman and auctioneer laughed cheerily. &ldquo;Once lost, twice get
      there,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a quizzical toss of the head, thinking he had
      said a good thing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a year ago to the very day that I was lost out
      back&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked a thumb over his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;and you picked me
      up and brought me in; and what was I to do but come out on the anniversary
      and say thank you? I&rsquo;d fixed up all year to come to you, and I wasn&rsquo;t to
      be stopped, &lsquo;cause it was like the day we first met, old Coldmaker hitting
      the world with his whips of frost, and shaking his ragged blankets of snow
      over the wild west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just such a day,&rdquo; said the Indian woman after a pause. Pauline remained
      silent, placing a little bottle of cordial before their visitor, with
      which he presently regaled himself, raising his glass with an air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many happy returns to us both!&rdquo; he said, and threw the liquor down his
      throat, smacked his lips, and drew his hand down his great moustache and
      beard like some vast animal washing its face with its paw. Smiling and yet
      not at ease, he looked at the two women and nodded his head encouragingly,
      but whether the encouragement was for himself or for them he could not
      have told.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last words, however, had altered the situation. The girl had caught at
      a suggestion in them which startled her. This rough white plainsman was
      come to make love to her, and to say&mdash;what? He was at once awkward
      and confident, afraid of her, of her refinement, grace, beauty, and
      education, and yet confident in the advantage of his position, a white man
      bending to a half-breed girl. He was not conscious of the condescension
      and majesty of his demeanour, but it was there, and his untutored words
      and ways must make it all too apparent to the girl. The revelation of the
      moment made her at once triumphant and humiliated. This white man had come
      to make love to her, that was apparent; but that he, ungrammatical, crude,
      and rough, should think he had but to put out his hand, and she in whom
      every subtle emotion and influence had delicate response, whose words and
      ways were as far removed from his as day from night, would fly to him,
      brought the flush of indignation to her cheek. She responded to his toast
      with a pleasant nod, however, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you will keep coming in such wild storms, there will not be many
      anniversaries.&rdquo; Laughing, she poured out another glass of liquor for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;re right, and so the only thing to do is not to
      keep coming, but to stay&mdash;stay right where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian woman could not see her daughter&rsquo;s face, which was turned to
      the fire, but she herself smiled at John Alloway, and nodded her head
      approvingly. Here was the cure for her own trouble and loneliness. Pauline
      and she, who lived in different worlds, and yet were tied to each other by
      circumstances they could not control, would each work out her own destiny
      after her own nature, since John Alloway had come a-wooing. She would go
      back on the Warais, and Pauline would remain at the Portage, a white woman
      with her white man. She would go back to the smoky fires in the huddled
      lodges; to the venison stew and the snake dance; to the feasts of the
      Medicine Men, and the long sleeps in the summer days, and the winter&rsquo;s
      tales, and be at rest among her own people; and Pauline would have revenge
      of the wife of the prancing Reeve, and perhaps the people would forget who
      her mother was.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts flying through her sluggish mind, she rose and moved
      heavily from the room, with a parting look of encouragement at Alloway, as
      though to say, a man that is bold is surest.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her back to the man, Pauline watched her mother leave the room, saw
      the look she gave Alloway. When the door was closed she turned and looked
      Alloway in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stirred in his seat nervously. &ldquo;Why, fifty, about,&rdquo; he answered with
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be wise not to go looking for anniversaries in blizzards,
      when they&rsquo;re few at the best,&rdquo; she said with a gentle and dangerous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty-why, I&rsquo;m as young as most men of thirty,&rdquo; he responded with an
      uncertain laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have come here to-day if it had been snowing
      pitchforks and chain-lightning. I made up my mind I would. You saved my
      life, that&rsquo;s dead sure; and I&rsquo;d be down among the moles if it wasn&rsquo;t for
      you and that Piegan pony of yours. Piegan ponies are wonders in a
      storm-seem to know their way by instinct. You, too&mdash;why, I bin on the
      plains all my life, and was no better than a baby that day; but you&mdash;why,
      you had Piegan in you, why, yes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short for a moment, checked by the look in her face, then went
      blindly on: &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got Blackfoot in you, too; and you just felt your
      way through the tornado and over the blind prairie like a bird reaching
      for the hills. It was as easy to you as picking out a moverick in a bunch
      of steers to me. But I never could make out what you was doing on the
      prairie that terrible day. I&rsquo;ve thought of it a hundred times. What was
      you doing, if it ain&rsquo;t cheek to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was trying to lose a life,&rdquo; she answered quietly, her eyes dwelling on
      his face, yet not seeing him; for it all came back on her, the agony which
      had driven her out into the tempest to be lost evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what they call
      speaking sarcastic. You was out to save, and not to lose, a life; that was
      proved to the satisfaction of the court.&rdquo; He paused and chuckled to
      himself, thinking he had been witty, and continued: &ldquo;And I was that court,
      and my judgment was that the debt of that life you saved had to be paid to
      you within one calendar year, with interest at the usual per cent for
      mortgages on good security. That was my judgment, and there&rsquo;s no appeal
      from it. I am the great Justinian in this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever save anybody&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; she asked, putting the bottle of
      cordial away, as he filled his glass for the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice certain, and once dividin&rsquo; the honours,&rdquo; he answered, pleased at
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you expect to get any pay, with or without interest?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I never thought of it again. But yes&mdash;by gol, I did! One case
      was funny, as funny can be. It was Ricky Wharton over on the Muskwat
      River. I saved his life right enough, and he came to me a year after and
      said, You saved my life, now what are you going to do with it? I&rsquo;m stony
      broke. I owe a hundred dollars, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be owing it if you hadn&rsquo;t
      saved my life. When you saved it I was five hunderd to the good, and I&rsquo;d
      have left that much behind me. Now I&rsquo;m on the rocks, because you insisted
      on saving my life; and you just got to take care of me.&rsquo; I &lsquo;insisted!&rsquo; 
      Well, that knocked me silly, and I took him on&mdash;blame me, if I didn&rsquo;t
      keep Ricky a whole year, till he went north looking for gold. Get pay&mdash;why,
      I paid! Saving life has its responsibilities, little gal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t save life without running some risk yourself, not as a rule,
      can you?&rdquo; she said, shrinking from his familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as a rule,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You took on a bit of risk with me, you and
      your Piegan pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was young,&rdquo; she responded, leaning over the table, and drawing
      faces on a piece of paper before her. &ldquo;I could take more risks, I was only
      nineteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t catch on,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s sixteen or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or fifty,&rdquo; she interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does it make? If you&rsquo;re done for, it&rsquo;s the same at
      nineteen as fifty, and vicey-versey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the same,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You leave so much more that you
      want to keep, when you go at fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dunno. I never thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s all that has belonged to you. You&rsquo;ve been married, and have
      children, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started, frowned, then straightened himself. &ldquo;I got one girl&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      east with her grandmother,&rdquo; he said jerkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said; there&rsquo;s more to leave behind at fifty,&rdquo; she replied,
      a red spot on each cheek. She was not looking at him, but at the face of a
      man on the paper before her&mdash;a young man with abundant hair, a strong
      chin, and big, eloquent eyes; and all around his face she had drawn the
      face of a girl many times, and beneath the faces of both she was writing
      Manette and Julien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was getting too deep for John Alloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He floundered towards the shore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good at words,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;no
      good at argyment; but I&rsquo;ve got a gift for stories&mdash;round the fire of
      a night, with a pipe and a tin basin of tea; so I&rsquo;m not going to try and
      match you. You&rsquo;ve had a good education down at Winnipeg. Took every prize,
      they say, and led the school, though there was plenty of fuss because they
      let you do it, and let you stay there, being half-Indian. You never heard
      what was going on outside, I s&rsquo;pose. It didn&rsquo;t matter, for you won out.
      Blamed foolishness, trying to draw the line between red and white that
      way. Of course, it&rsquo;s the women always, always the women, striking out for
      all-white or nothing. Down there at Portage they&rsquo;ve treated you mean, mean
      as dirt. The Reeve&rsquo;s wife&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll fix that up all right. I guess
      John Alloway ain&rsquo;t to be bluffed. He knows too much and they all know he
      knows enough. When John Alloway, 32 Main Street, with a ranch on the
      Katanay, says, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re coming&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. John Alloway is coming,&rsquo; 
      they&rsquo;ll get out their cards visite, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline&rsquo;s head bent lower, and she seemed laboriously etching lines into
      the faces before her&mdash;Manette and Julien, Julien and Manette; and
      there came into her eyes the youth and light and gaiety of the days when
      Julien came of an afternoon and the riverside rang with laughter; the
      dearest, lightest days she had ever spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of fifty went on, seeing nothing but a girl over whom he was
      presently going to throw the lasso of his affection, and take her home
      with him, yielding and glad, a white man, and his half-breed girl&mdash;but
      such a half-breed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen enough of the way some of them women treated you,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;and I sez to myself, Her turn next. There&rsquo;s a way out, I sez, and John
      Alloway pays his debts. When the anniversary comes round I&rsquo;ll put things
      right, I sez to myself. She saved my life, and she shall have the rest of
      it, if she&rsquo;ll take it, and will give a receipt in full, and open a new
      account in the name of John and Pauline Alloway. Catch it? See&mdash;Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she got to her feet. There was a look in her eyes such as had been
      in her mother&rsquo;s a little while before, but a hundred times intensified: a
      look that belonged to the flood and flow of generations of Indian life,
      yet controlled in her by the order and understanding of centuries of white
      men&rsquo;s lives, the pervasive, dominating power of race.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she kept her eyes towards the window. The storm had
      suddenly ceased, and a glimmer of sunset light was breaking over the
      distant wastes of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to pay a debt you think you owe,&rdquo; she said, in a strange,
      lustreless voice, turning to him at last. &ldquo;Well, you have paid it. You
      have given me a book to read which I will keep always. And I give you a
      receipt in full for your debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about any book,&rdquo; he answered dazedly. &ldquo;I want to marry you
      right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, but it is not necessary,&rdquo; she replied suggestively. Her face
      was very pale now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to. It ain&rsquo;t a debt. That was only a way of putting it. I want
      to make you my wife. I got some position, and I can make the West sit up,
      and look at you and be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly her anger flared out, low and vivid and fierce, but her words
      were slow and measured. &ldquo;There is no reason why I should marry you&mdash;not
      one. You offer me marriage as a prince might give a penny to a beggar. If
      my mother were not an Indian woman, you would not have taken it all as a
      matter of course. But my father was a white man, and I am a white man&rsquo;s
      daughter, and I would rather marry an Indian, who would think me the best
      thing there was in the light of the sun, than marry you. Had I been pure
      white you would not have been so sure, you would have asked, not offered.
      I am not obliged to you. You ought to go to no woman as you came to me.
      See, the storm has stopped. You will be quite safe going back now. The
      snow will be deep, perhaps, but it is not far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the window, got his cap and gloves, and handed them to him. He
      took them, dumbfounded and overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I ain&rsquo;t done it right, mebbe, but I meant well, and I&rsquo;d be good to
      you and proud of you, and I&rsquo;d love you better than anything I ever saw,&rdquo;
       he said shamefacedly, but eagerly and honestly too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you should have said those last words first,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They come too late; but they would have been too late in any case,&rdquo; she
      added. &ldquo;Still, I am glad you said them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made a mistake,&rdquo; he urged humbly. &ldquo;I understand better now. I never had
      any schoolin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; she answered gently. &ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he turned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t ever be,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re great. And I owe you my life still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped out into the biting air.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Pauline stood motionless in the middle of the room, her gaze
      fixed upon the door which had just closed; then, with a wild gesture of
      misery and despair, she threw herself upon the couch in a passionate
      outburst of weeping. Sobs shook her from head to foot, and her hands,
      clenched above her head, twitched convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door opened and her mother looked in eagerly. At what she
      saw her face darkened and hardened for an instant, but then the girl&rsquo;s
      utter abandonment of grief and agony convinced and conquered her. Some
      glimmer of the true understanding of the problem which Pauline represented
      got into her heart, and drove the sullen selfishness from her face and
      eyes and mind. She came over heavily and, sinking upon her knees, swept an
      arm around the girl&rsquo;s shoulder. She realised what had happened, and
      probably this was the first time in her life that she had ever come by
      instinct to a revelation of her daughter&rsquo;s mind, or of the faithful
      meaning of incidents of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said no to John Alloway,&rdquo; she murmured. Defiance and protest spoke in
      the swift gesture of the girl&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;You think because he was white
      that I&rsquo;d drop into his arms! No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did right, little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sobs suddenly stopped, and the girl seemed to listen with all her
      body. There was something in her Indian mother&rsquo;s voice she had never heard
      before&mdash;at least, not since she was a little child, and swung in a
      deer-skin hammock in a tamarac tree by Renton&rsquo;s Lodge, where the chiefs
      met, and the West paused to rest on its onward march. Something of the
      accents of the voice that crooned to her then was in the woman&rsquo;s tones
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He offered it like a lump of sugar to a bird&mdash;I know. He didn&rsquo;t know
      that you have great blood&mdash;yes, but it is true. My man&rsquo;s grandfather,
      he was of the blood of the kings of England. My man had the proof. And for
      a thousand years my people have been chiefs. There is no blood in all the
      West like yours. My heart was heavy, and dark thoughts came to me, because
      my man is gone, and the life is not my life, and I am only an Indian woman
      from the Warais, and my heart goes out there always now. But some great
      Medicine has been poured into my heart. As I stood at the door and saw you
      lying there, I called to the Sun. &lsquo;O great Spirit,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;help me to
      understand; for this girl is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, and
      Evil has come between us!&rsquo; And the Sun Spirit poured the Medicine into my
      spirit, and there is no cloud between us now. It has passed away, and I
      see. Little white one, the white life is the only life, and I will live it
      with you till a white man comes and gives you a white man&rsquo;s home. But not
      John Alloway&mdash;shall the crow nest with the oriole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the woman spoke with slow, measured voice, full of the cadences of a
      heart revealing itself, the girl&rsquo;s breath at first seemed to stop, so
      still she lay; then, as the true understanding of the words came to her,
      she panted with excitement, her breast heaved, and the blood flushed her
      face. When the slow voice ceased, and the room became still, she lay quiet
      for a moment, letting the new thing find secure lodgment in her thought;
      then, suddenly, she raised herself and threw her arms round her mother in
      a passion of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lalika! O mother Lalika!&rdquo; she said tenderly, and kissed her again and
      again. Not since she was a little girl, long before they left the Warais,
      had she called her mother by her Indian name, which her father had
      humorously taught her to do in those far-off happy days by the beautiful,
      singing river and the exquisite woods, when, with a bow and arrow, she had
      ranged a young Diana who slew only with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lalika, mother Lalika, it is like the old, old times,&rdquo; she added softly.
      &ldquo;Ah, it does not matter now, for you understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand altogether,&rdquo; murmured the Indian woman gently. &ldquo;I am
      not white, and there is a different way of thinking; but I will hold your
      hand, and we will live the white life together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cheek to cheek they saw the darkness come, and, afterwards, the silver
      moon steal up over a frozen world, in which the air bit like steel and
      braced the heart like wine. Then, at last, before it was nine o&rsquo;clock,
      after her custom, the Indian woman went to bed, leaving her daughter
      brooding peacefully by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Pauline sat with hands clasped in her lap, her gaze on the
      tossing flames, in her heart and mind a new feeling of strength and
      purpose. The way before her was not clear, she saw no further than this
      day, and all that it had brought; yet she was as one that has crossed a
      direful flood and finds herself on a strange shore in an unknown country,
      with the twilight about her, yet with so much of danger passed that there
      was only the thought of the moment&rsquo;s safety round her, the camp-fire to be
      lit, and the bed to be made under the friendly trees and stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a half-hour she sat so, and then, suddenly, she raised her head
      listening, leaning towards the window, through which the moonlight
      streamed. She heard her name called without, distinct and strange&mdash;&ldquo;Pauline!
      Pauline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starting up, she ran to the door and opened it. All was silent and cruelly
      cold. Nothing but the wide plain of snow and the steely air. But as she
      stood intently listening, the red glow from the fire behind her, again
      came the cry&mdash;&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; not far away. Her heart beat hard, and she
      raised her head and called&mdash;why was it she should call out in a
      language not her own? &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;appelle? Qu&rsquo;appelle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And once again on the still night air came the trembling appeal&mdash;&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;appelle? Qu&rsquo;appelle?&rdquo; she cried, then, with a gasping murmur of
      understanding and recognition she ran forwards in the frozen night towards
      the sound of the voice. The same intuitive sense which had made her call
      out in French, without thought or reason, had revealed to her who it was
      that called; or was it that even in the one word uttered there was the
      note of a voice always remembered since those days with Manette at
      Winnipeg?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far away from the house, on the way to Portage la Drome, but a little
      distance from the road, was a crevasse, and towards this she sped, for
      once before an accident had happened there. Again the voice called as she
      sped&mdash;&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; and she cried out that she was coming. Presently she
      stood above the declivity, and peered over. Almost immediately below her,
      a few feet down, was a man lying in the snow. He had strayed from the
      obliterated road, and had fallen down the crevasse, twisting his foot
      cruelly. Unable to walk he had crawled several hundred yards in the snow,
      but his strength had given out, and then he had called to the house, on
      whose dark windows flickered the flames of the fire, the name of the girl
      he had come so far to see. With a cry of joy and pain at once she
      recognised him now. It was as her heart had said&mdash;it was Julien,
      Manette&rsquo;s brother. In a moment she was beside him, her arm around his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; he said feebly, and fainted in her arms. An instant later she
      was speeding to the house, and, rousing her mother and two of the
      stablemen, she snatched a flask of brandy from a cupboard and hastened
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Julien Labrosse lay in the great sitting-room beside the
      fire, his foot and ankle bandaged, and at ease, his face alight with all
      that had brought him there. And once again the Indian mother with a sure
      instinct knew why he had come, and saw that now her girl would have a
      white woman&rsquo;s home, and, for her man, one of the race like her father&rsquo;s
      race, white and conquering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to give trouble,&rdquo; Julien said, laughing&mdash;he had a trick of
      laughing lightly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be able to get back to the Portage to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this the Indian mother said, however: &ldquo;To please yourself is a great
      thing, but to please others is better; and so you will stay here till you
      can walk back to the Portage, M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Julien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never been so comfortable,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;never so&mdash;happy.
      If you don&rsquo;t mind the trouble!&rdquo; The Indian woman nodded pleasantly, and
      found an excuse to leave the room. But before she went she contrived to
      place near his elbow one of the scraps of paper on which Pauline had drawn
      his face, with that of Manette. It brought a light of hope and happiness
      into his eyes, and he thrust the paper under the fur robes of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing with your life?&rdquo; Pauline asked him, as his eyes sought
      hers a few moments later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have a big piece of work before me,&rdquo; he answered eagerly, &ldquo;a great
      chance&mdash;to build a bridge over the St. Lawrence, and I&rsquo;m only thirty!
      I&rsquo;ve got my start. Then, I&rsquo;ve made over the old Seigneury my father left
      me, and I&rsquo;m going to live in it. It will be a fine place, when I&rsquo;ve done
      with it&mdash;comfortable and big, with old oak timbers and walls, and
      deep fireplaces, and carvings done in the time of Louis Quinze, and dark
      red velvet curtains for the drawingroom, and skins and furs. Yes, I must
      have skins and furs like these here.&rdquo; He smoothed the skins with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manette, she will live with you?&rdquo; Pauline asked. &ldquo;Oh no, her husband
      wouldn&rsquo;t like that. You see, Manette is to be married. She told me to tell
      you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told her all there was to tell of Manette&rsquo;s courtship, and added that
      the wedding would take place in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manette wanted it when the leaves first flourish and the birds come
      back,&rdquo; he said gaily; &ldquo;and so she&rsquo;s not going to live with me at the
      Seigneury, you see. No, there it is, as fine a house, good enough for a
      prince, and I shall be there alone, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes met hers, and he caught the light that was in them, before the
      eyelids drooped over them and she turned her head to the fire. &ldquo;But the
      spring is two months off yet,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spring?&rdquo; she asked, puzzled, yet half afraid to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going into my new house when Manette goes into her new house&mdash;in
      the spring. And I won&rsquo;t go alone if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her eyes again, but she rose hurriedly and said: &ldquo;You must sleep
      now. Good-night.&rdquo; She held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you the rest to-morrow-to-morrow night when it&rsquo;s quiet
      like this, and the stars shine,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a home of
      my own like this&mdash;ah, bien sur, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night the old Indian mother prayed to the Sun. &ldquo;O great Spirit,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;I give thanks for the Medicine poured into my heart. Be good to my
      white child when she goes with her man to the white man&rsquo;s home far away. O
      great Spirit, when I return to the lodges of my people, be kind to me, for
      I shall be lonely; I shall not have my child; I shall not hear my white
      man&rsquo;s voice. Give me good Medicine, O Sun and great Father, till my dream
      tells me that my man comes from over the hills for me once more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE STAKE AND THE PLUMB-LINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      She went against all good judgment in marrying him; she cut herself off
      from her own people, from the life in which she had been an alluring and
      beautiful figure. Washington had never had two such seasons as those in
      which she moved; for the diplomatic circle who had had &ldquo;the run of the
      world&rdquo; knew her value, and were not content without her. She might have
      made a brilliant match with one ambassador thirty years older than herself&mdash;she
      was but twenty-two; and there were at least six attaches and secretaries
      of legation who entered upon a tournament for her heart and hand; but she
      was not for them. All her fine faculties of tact and fairness, of harmless
      strategy, and her gifts of wit and unexpected humour were needed to keep
      her cavaliers constant and hopeful to the last; but she never faltered,
      and she did not fail. The faces of old men brightened when they saw her,
      and one or two ancient figures who, for years, had been seldom seen at
      social functions now came when they knew she was to be present. There
      were, of course, a few women who said she would coquette with any male
      from nine to ninety; but no man ever said so; and there was none, from
      first to last, but smiled with pleasure at even the mention of her name,
      so had her vivacity, intelligence, and fine sympathy conquered them. She
      was a social artist by instinct. In their hearts they all recognised how
      fair and impartial she was; and she drew out of every man the best that
      was in him. The few women who did not like her said that she chattered;
      but the truth was she made other people talk by swift suggestion or
      delicate interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the blow fell, Freddy Hartzman put the matter succinctly, and told
      the truth faithfully, when he said, &ldquo;The first time I met her, I told her
      all I&rsquo;d ever done that could be told, and all I wanted to do; including a
      resolve to carry her off to some desert place and set up a Kingdom of Two.
      I don&rsquo;t know how she did it. I was like a tap, and poured myself out; and
      when it was all over, I thought she was the best talker I&rsquo;d ever heard.
      But yet she&rsquo;d done nothing except look at me and listen, and put in a
      question here and there, that was like a baby asking to see your watch.
      Oh, she was a lily-flower, was Sally Seabrook, and I&rsquo;ve never been sorry I
      told her all my little story! It did me good. Poor darling&mdash;it makes
      me sick sometimes when I think of it. Yet she&rsquo;ll win out all right&mdash;a
      hundred to one she&rsquo;ll win out. She was a star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freddy Hartzman was in an embassy of repute; he knew the chancelleries and
      salons of many nations, and was looked upon as one of the ablest and
      shrewdest men in the diplomatic service. He had written one of the best
      books on international law in existence, he talked English like a native,
      he had published a volume of delightful verse, and had omitted to publish
      several others, including a tiny volume which Sally Seabrook&rsquo;s charms had
      inspired him to write. His view of her was shared by most men who knew the
      world, and especially by the elderly men who had a real knowledge of human
      nature, among whom was a certain important member of the United States
      executive called John Appleton. When the end of all things at Washington
      came for Sally, these two men united to bear her up, that her feet should
      not stumble upon the stony path of the hard journey she had undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appleton was not a man of much speech, but his words had weight; for he
      was not only a minister; he came of an old family which had ruled the
      social destinies of a state, and had alternately controlled and disturbed
      its politics. On the day of the sensation, in the fiery cloud of which
      Sally disappeared, Appleton delivered himself of his mind in the matter at
      a reception given by the President.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will come back&mdash;and we will all take her back, be glad to have
      her back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She has the grip of a lever which can lift the
      eternal hills with the right pressure. Leave her alone&mdash;leave her
      alone. This is a democratic country, and she&rsquo;ll prove democracy a success
      before she&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world knew that John Appleton had offered her marriage, and he had
      never hidden the fact. What they did not know was that she had told him
      what she meant to do before she did it. He had spoken to her plainly,
      bluntly, then with a voice that was blurred and a little broken, urging
      her against the course towards which she was set; but it had not availed;
      and, realising that he had come upon a powerful will underneath the sunny
      and so human surface, he had ceased to protest, to bear down upon her mind
      with his own iron force. When he realised that all his reasoning was
      wasted, that all worldly argument was vain, he made one last attempt, a
      forlorn hope, as though to put upon record what he believed to be the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no position you cannot occupy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have the perfect
      gift in private life, and you have a public gift. You have a genius for
      ruling. Say, my dear, don&rsquo;t wreck it all. I know you are not for me, but
      there are better men in the country than I am. Hartzman will be a great
      man one day&mdash;he wants you. Young Tilden wants you; he has millions,
      and he will never disgrace them or you, the power which they can command,
      and the power which you have. And there are others. Your people have told
      you they will turn you off; the world will say things&mdash;will rend you.
      There is nothing so popular for the moment as the fall of a favourite. But
      that&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing at all compared with the danger to
      yourself. I didn&rsquo;t sleep last night thinking of it. Yet I&rsquo;m glad you wrote
      me; it gave me time to think, and I can tell you the truth as I see it.
      Haven&rsquo;t you thought that he will drag you down, down, down, wear out your
      soul, break and sicken your life, destroy your beauty&mdash;you are
      beautiful, my dear, beyond what the world sees, even. Give it up&mdash;ah,
      give it up, and don&rsquo;t break our hearts! There are too many people loving
      you for you to sacrifice them&mdash;and yourself, too.... You&rsquo;ve had such
      a good time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been like a dream,&rdquo; she interrupted, in a faraway voice, &ldquo;like a
      dream, these two years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s been such a good dream,&rdquo; he urged; &ldquo;and you will only go to a
      bad one, from which you will never wake. The thing has fastened on him; he
      will never give it up. And penniless, too&mdash;his father has cast him
      off. My girl, it&rsquo;s impossible. Listen to me. There&rsquo;s no one on earth that
      would do more for you than I would&mdash;no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear friend!&rdquo; she cried with a sudden impulse, and caught his hand
      in hers and kissed it before he could draw it back. &ldquo;You are so true, and
      you think you are right. But, but&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes took on a deep, steady,
      far-away look&mdash;&ldquo;but I will save him; and we shall not be penniless in
      the end. Meanwhile I have seven hundred dollars a year of my own. No one
      can touch that. Nothing can change me now&mdash;and I have promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he saw her fixed determination, he made no further protest, but asked
      that he might help her, be with her the next day, when she was to take a
      step which the wise world would say must lead to sorrow and a miserable
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The step she took was to marry Jim Templeton, the drunken, cast-off son of
      a millionaire senator from Kentucky, who controlled railways, and owned a
      bank, and had so resented his son&rsquo;s inebriate habits that for five years
      he had never permitted Jim&rsquo;s name to be mentioned in his presence. Jim had
      had twenty thousand dollars left him by his mother, and a small income of
      three hundred dollars from an investment which had been made for him when
      a little boy. And this had carried him on; for, drunken as he was, he had
      sense enough to eke out the money, limiting himself to three thousand
      dollars a year. He had four thousand dollars left, and his tiny income of
      three hundred, when he went to Sally Seabrook, after having been sober for
      a month, and begged her to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dissipation had made him look ten years older than he was, there
      had been no handsomer man in all America. Even yet he had a remarkable
      face; long, delicate, with dark brown eyes, as fair a forehead as man
      could wish, and black, waving hair, streaked with grey-grey, though he was
      but twenty-nine years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sally was fifteen and he twenty-two, he had fallen in love with her
      and she with him; and nothing had broken the early romance. He had
      captured her young imagination, and had fastened his image on her heart.
      Her people, seeing the drift of things, had sent her to a school on the
      Hudson, and the two did not meet for some time. Then came a stolen
      interview, and a fastening of the rivets of attraction&mdash;for Jim had
      gifts of a wonderful kind. He knew his Horace and Anacreon and Heine and
      Lamartine and Dante in the originals, and a hundred others; he was a
      speaker of power and grace; and he had a clear, strong head for business.
      He was also a lawyer, and was junior attorney to his father&rsquo;s great
      business. It was because he had the real business gift, not because he had
      a brilliant and scholarly mind, that his father had taken him into his
      concerns, and was the more unforgiving when he gave way to temptation.
      Otherwise, he would have pensioned Jim off, and dismissed him from his
      mind as a useless, insignificant person; for Horace, Anacreon, and
      philosophy and history were to him the recreations of the feeble-minded.
      He had set his heart on Jim, and what Jim could do and would do by and by
      in the vast financial concerns he controlled, when he was ready to slip
      out and down; but Jim had disappointed him beyond calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early days of their association Jim had left his post and taken to
      drink at critical moments in their operations. At first, high words had
      been spoken; then there came the strife of two dissimilar natures, and
      both were headstrong, and each proud and unrelenting in his own way. Then,
      at last, had come the separation, irrevocable and painful; and Jim had
      flung out into the world, a drunkard, who, sober for a fortnight or a
      month, or three months, would afterward go off on a spree, in which he
      quoted Sappho and Horace in taverns, and sang bacchanalian songs with a
      voice meant for the stage&mdash;a heritage from an ancestor who had sung
      upon the English stage a hundred years before. Even in his cups, even
      after his darling vice had submerged him, Jim Templeton was a man marked
      out from his fellows, distinguished and very handsome. Society, however,
      had ceased to recognise him for a long time, and he did not seek it. For
      two or three years he practised law now and then. He took cases,
      preferably criminal cases, for which very often he got no pay; but that,
      too, ceased at last. Now, in his quiet, sober intervals he read
      omnivorously, and worked out problems in physics for which he had a taste,
      until the old appetite surged over him again. Then his spirits rose, and
      he was the old brilliant talker, the joyous galliard until, in due time,
      he became silently and lethargically drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of his sober intervals he had met Sally Seabrook in the street. It
      was the first time in four years, for he had avoided her, and though she
      had written to him once or twice, he had never answered her&mdash;shame
      was in his heart. Yet all the time the old song was in Sally&rsquo;s ears. Jim
      Templeton had touched her in some distant and intimate corner of her
      nature where none other had reached; and in all her gay life, when men had
      told their tale of admiration in their own way, her mind had gone back to
      Jim, and what he had said under the magnolia trees; and his voice had
      drowned all others. She was not blind to what he had become, but a deep
      belief possessed her that she, of all the world, could save him. She knew
      how futile it would look to the world, how wild a dream it looked even to
      her own heart, how perilous it was; but, play upon the surface of things
      as she had done so much and so often in her brief career, she was seized
      of convictions having origin, as it might seem, in something beyond
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when she and Jim met in the street, the old true thing rushed upon them
      both, and for a moment they stood still and looked at each other. As they
      might look who say farewell forever, so did each dwell upon the other&rsquo;s
      face. That was the beginning of the new epoch. A few days more, and Jim
      came to her and said that she alone could save him; and she meant him to
      say it, had led him to the saying, for the same conviction was burned deep
      in her own soul. She knew the awful risk she was taking, that the step
      must mean social ostracism, and that her own people would be no kinder to
      her than society; but she gasped a prayer, smiled at Jim as though all
      were well, laid her plans, made him promise her one thing on his knees,
      and took the plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her people did as she expected. She was threatened with banishment from
      heart and home&mdash;with disinheritance; but she pursued her course; and
      the only person who stood with her and Jim at the altar was John Appleton,
      who would not be denied, and who had such a half-hour with Jim before the
      ceremony as neither of them forgot in the years that the locust ate
      thereafter. And, standing at the altar, Jim&rsquo;s eyes were still wet, with
      new resolves in his heart and a being at his side meant for the best man
      in the world. As he knelt beside her, awaiting the benediction, a sudden
      sense of the enormity of this act came upon him, and for her sake he would
      have drawn back then, had it not been too late. He realised that it was a
      crime to put this young, beautiful life in peril; that his own life was a
      poor, contemptible thing, and that he had been possessed of the egotism of
      the selfish and the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thing was done, and a new life was begun. Before they were
      launched upon it, however, before society had fully grasped the sensation,
      or they had left upon their journey to northern Canada, where Sally
      intended they should work out their problem and make their home, far and
      free from all old associations, a curious thing happened. Jim&rsquo;s father
      sent an urgent message to Sally to come to him. When she came, he told her
      she was mad, and asked her why she had thrown her life away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you done it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&mdash;you knew all about him; you
      might have married the best man in the country. You could rule a kingdom;
      you have beauty and power, and make people do what you want: and you&rsquo;ve
      got a sot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is your son,&rdquo; she answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked so beautiful and so fine as she stood there, fearless and
      challenging before him, that he was moved. But he would not show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my son&mdash;when he was a man,&rdquo; he retorted grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the son of the woman you once loved,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned his head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would she have said to what you did to Jim?&rdquo; He drew himself around
      sharply. Her dagger had gone home, but he would not let her know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave her out of the question&mdash;she was a saint,&rdquo; he said roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot be left out; nor can you. He got his temperament naturally; he
      inherited his weakness from your grandfather, from her father. Do you
      think you are in no way responsible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment, but then said stubbornly: &ldquo;Why&mdash;why have
      you done it? What&rsquo;s between him and me can&rsquo;t be helped; we are father and
      son; but you&mdash;you had no call, no responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Jim. I always loved him, ever since I can remember, as you did. I
      see my way ahead. I will not desert him. No one cares what happens to him,
      no one but me. Your love wouldn&rsquo;t stand the test; mine will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your folks have disinherited you,&mdash;you have almost nothing, and I
      will not change my mind. What do you see ahead of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim&mdash;only Jim&mdash;and God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were shining, her hands were clasped together at her side in the
      tenseness of her feeling, her indomitable spirit spoke in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the old man brought his fist down on the table with a bang. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a crime&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s a crime, to risk your life so! You ought to have
      been locked up. I&rsquo;d have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; she rejoined quietly. &ldquo;I know the risk. But do you think
      that I could have lived my life out, feeling that I might have saved Jim,
      and didn&rsquo;t try? You talk of beauty and power and ruling&mdash;you say what
      others have said to me. Which is the greater thing, to get what pleases
      one, or to work for something which is more to one than all else in the
      world? To save one life, one intellect, one great man&mdash;oh, he has the
      making of a great man in him!&mdash;to save a soul, would not life be well
      lost, would not love be well spent in doing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s labour lost,&rdquo; said the old man slowly, cynically, but not without
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ambition,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;No girl was ever more ambitious, but my
      ambition is to make the most and best of myself. Place?&mdash;Jim and I
      will hold it yet. Power?&mdash;it shall be as it must be; but Jim and I
      will work for it to fulfil ourselves. For me&mdash;ah, if I can save him&mdash;and
      I mean to do so&mdash;do you think that I would not then have my heaven on
      earth? You want money&mdash;money&mdash;money, power, and to rule; and
      these are to you the best things in the world. I make my choice
      differently, though I would have these other things if I could; and I hope
      I shall. But Jim first&mdash;Jim first, your son, Jim&mdash;my husband,
      Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man got to his feet slowly. She had him at bay. &ldquo;But you are
      great,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;great! It is an awful stake&mdash;awful. Yet if you win,
      you&rsquo;ll have what money can&rsquo;t buy. And listen to me. We&rsquo;ll make the stake
      bigger. It will give it point, too, in another way. If you keep Jim sober
      for four years from the day of your marriage, on the last day of that four
      years I&rsquo;ll put in your hands for you and him, or for your child&mdash;if
      you have one&mdash;five millions of dollars. I am a man of my word. While
      Jim drinks I won&rsquo;t take him back; he&rsquo;s disinherited. I&rsquo;ll give him nothing
      now or hereafter. Save him for four years,&mdash;if he can do that he will
      do all, and there&rsquo;s five millions as sure as the sun&rsquo;s in heaven. Amen and
      amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door. There was a strange soft light in her eyes as she came
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to kiss me?&rdquo; she said, looking at him whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was disconcerted. She did not wait, but reached up and kissed him on
      the cheek. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she said with a smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win the stake.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An instant, and she was gone. He shut the door, then turned and looked in
      a mirror on the wall. Abstractedly he touched the cheek she had kissed.
      Suddenly a change passed over his face. He dropped in a chair, and his
      fist struck the table as he said: &ldquo;By God, she may do it, she may do it!
      But it&rsquo;s life and death&mdash;it&rsquo;s life and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Society had its sensation, and then the veil dropped. For a long time none
      looked behind it except Jim&rsquo;s father. He had too much at stake not to have
      his telescope upon them. A detective followed them to keep Jim&rsquo;s record.
      But this they did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day they left Washington Jim put his life and his fate in his
      wife&rsquo;s hands. He meant to follow her judgment, and, self-willed and strong
      in intellect as he was, he said that she should have a fair chance of
      fulfilling her purpose. There had been many pour parlers as to what Jim
      should do. There was farming. She set that aside, because it meant
      capital, and it also meant monotony and loneliness; and capital was
      limited, and monotony and loneliness were bad for Jim, deadening an active
      brain which must not be deprived of stimulants&mdash;stimulants of a
      different sort, however, from those which had heretofore mastered it.
      There was the law. But Jim would have to become a citizen of Canada,
      change his flag, and where they meant to go&mdash;to the outskirts&mdash;there
      would be few opportunities for the law; and with not enough to do there
      would be danger. Railway construction? That seemed good in many ways, but
      Jim had not the professional knowledge necessary; his railway experience
      with his father had only been financial. Above all else he must have
      responsibility, discipline, and strict order in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that will be good for my natural vanity, and knock the nonsense
      out of me,&rdquo; Jim agreed, as they drew farther and farther away from
      Washington and the past, and nearer and nearer to the Far North and their
      future. Never did two more honest souls put their hands in each other&rsquo;s,
      and set forth upon the thorniest path to a goal which was their hearts&rsquo; 
      desire. Since they had become one, there had come into Sally&rsquo;s face that
      illumination which belongs only to souls possessed of an idea greater than
      themselves, outside themselves&mdash;saints, patriots; faces which have
      been washed in the salt tears dropped for others&rsquo; sorrows, and lighted by
      the fire of self-sacrifice. Sally Seabrook, the high-spirited, the
      radiant, the sweetly wilful, the provoking, to concentrate herself upon
      this narrow theme&mdash;to reconquer the lost paradise of one vexed mortal
      soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      What did Jim&rsquo;s life mean?&mdash;It was only one in the millions coming and
      going, and every man must work out his own salvation. Why should she cramp
      her soul to this one issue, when the same soul could spend itself upon the
      greater motives and in the larger circle? A wide world of influence had
      opened up before her; position, power, adulation, could all have been
      hers, as John Appleton and Jim&rsquo;s father had said. She might have moved in
      well-trodden ways, through gardens of pleasure, lived a life where all
      would be made easy, where she would be shielded at every turn, and her
      beauty would be flattered by luxury into a constant glow. She was not so
      primitive, so unintellectual, as not to have thought of this, else her
      decision would have had less importance; she would have been no more than
      an infatuated emotional woman with a touch of second class drama in her
      nature. She had thought of it all, and she had made her choice. The easier
      course was the course for meaner souls, and she had not one vein of thin
      blood nor a small idea in her whole nature. She had a heart and mind for
      great issues. She believed that Jim had a great brain, and would and could
      accomplish great things. She knew that he had in him the strain of
      hereditary instinct&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s father had ended a brief life in a
      drunken duel on the Mississippi, and Jim&rsquo;s boyhood had never had
      discipline or direction, or any strenuous order. He might never acquire
      order, and the power that order and habit and the daily iteration of
      necessary thoughts and acts bring; but the prospect did not appal her. She
      had taken the risk with her eyes wide open; had set her own life and
      happiness in the hazard. But Jim must be saved, must be what his talents,
      his genius, entitled him to be. And the long game must have the long
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as they drew into the great Saskatchewan Valley, her hand in his, and
      hope in his eyes, and such a look of confidence and pride in her as
      brought back his old strong beauty of face, and smoothed the careworn
      lines of self-indulgence, she gave him his course: as a private he must
      join the North-West Mounted Police, the red-coated riders of the plains,
      and work his way up through every stage of responsibility, beginning at
      the foot of the ladder of humbleness and self-control. She believed that
      he would agree with her proposal; but her hands clasped his a little more
      firmly and solicitously&mdash;there was a faint, womanly fear at her heart&mdash;as
      she asked him if he would do it. The life meant more than occasional
      separation; it meant that there would be periods when she would not be
      with him; and there was great danger in that; but she knew that the risks
      must be taken, and he must not be wholly reliant on her presence for his
      moral strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face fell for a moment when she made the suggestion, but it cleared
      presently, and he said with a dry laugh: &ldquo;Well, I guess they must make me
      a sergeant pretty quick. I&rsquo;m a colonel in the Kentucky Carbineers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, too; then a moment afterwards, womanlike, wondered if she was
      right, and was a little frightened. But that was only because she was not
      self-opinionated, and was anxious, more anxious than any woman in all the
      North.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened as Jim said; he was made a sergeant at once&mdash;Sally
      managed that; for, when it came to the point, and she saw the conditions
      in which the privates lived, and realised that Jim must be one of them and
      clean out the stables, and groom his horse and the officers&rsquo; horses, and
      fetch and carry, her heart failed her, and she thought that she was making
      her remedy needlessly heroical. So she went to see the Commissioner, who
      was on a tour of scrutiny on their arrival at the post, and, as better men
      than he had done in more knowing circles, he fell under her spell. If she
      had asked for a lieutenancy, he would probably have corrupted some member
      of Parliament into securing it for Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was made a sergeant, and the Commissioner and the captain of the
      troop kept their eyes on him. So did other members of the troop who did
      not quite know their man, and attempted, figuratively, to pinch him here
      and there. They found that his actions were greater than his words, and
      both were in perfect harmony in the end, though his words often seemed
      pointless to their minds, until they understood that they had conveyed
      truths through a medium more like a heliograph than a telephone. By and by
      they begin to understand his heliographing, and, when they did that, they
      began to swear by him, not at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time it was found that the troop never had a better disciplinarian than
      Jim. He knew when to shut his eyes, and when to keep them open. To
      non-essentials he kept his eyes shut; to essentials he kept them very wide
      open. There were some men of good birth from England and elsewhere among
      them, and these mostly understood him first. But they all understood Sally
      from the beginning, and after a little they were glad enough to be
      permitted to come, on occasion, to the five-roomed little house near the
      barracks, and hear her talk, then answer her questions, and, as men had
      done at Washington, open out their hearts to her. They noticed, however,
      that while she made them barley-water, and all kinds of soft drinks from
      citric acid, sarsaparilla and the like, and had one special drink of her
      own invention, which she called cream-nectar, no spirits were to be had.
      They also noticed that Jim never drank a drop of liquor, and by and by,
      one way or another, they got a glimmer of the real truth, before it became
      known who he really was or anything of his story. And the interest in the
      two, and in Jim&rsquo;s reformation, spread through the country, while Jim
      gained reputation as the smartest man in the force.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on the outskirts of civilisation; as Jim used to say, &ldquo;One step
      ahead of the procession.&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s duty was to guard the columns of
      settlement and progress, and to see that every man got his own rights and
      not more than his rights; that justice should be the plumb-line of march
      and settlement. His principle was embodied in certain words which he
      quoted once to Sally from the prophet Amos: &ldquo;And the Lord said unto me,
      Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the day that Jim became a lieutenant his family increased by one. It
      was a girl, and they called her Nancy, after Jim&rsquo;s mother. It was the
      anniversary of their marriage, and, so far, Jim had won, with what
      fightings and strugglings and wrestlings of the spirit only Sally and
      himself knew. And she knew as well as he, and always saw the storm coming
      before it broke&mdash;a restlessness, then a moodiness, then a hungry,
      eager, helpless look, and afterwards an agony of longing, a feverish
      desire to break away and get the thrilling thing which would still the
      demon within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been moments when his doom seemed certain&mdash;he knew and she
      knew that if he once got drunk again he would fall never to rise. On one
      occasion, after a hard, long, hungry ride, he was half-mad with desire,
      but even as he seized the flask that was offered to him by his only enemy,
      the captain of B Troop, at the next station eastward, there came a sudden
      call to duty, two hundred Indians having gone upon the war-path. It saved
      him; it broke the spell. He had to mount and away, with the antidote and
      stimulant of responsibility driving him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another occasion was equally perilous to his safety. They had been idle
      for days in a hot week in summer, waiting for orders to return from the
      rail-head where they had gone to quell a riot, and where drink and
      hilarity were common. Suddenly&mdash;more suddenly than it had ever come,
      the demon of his thirst had Jim by the throat. Sergeant Sewell, of the
      grey-stubble head, who loved him more than his sour heart had loved
      anybody in all his life, was holding himself ready for the physical
      assault he must make upon his superior officer, if he raised a glass to
      his lips, when salvation came once again. An accident had occurred far
      down on the railway line, and the operator of the telegraph-office had
      that very day been stricken down with pleurisy and pneumonia. In despair
      the manager had sent to Jim, eagerly hoping that he might help them, for
      the Riders of the Plains were a sort of court of appeal for every trouble
      in the Far North.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Jim was in the saddle with his troop. Out of curiosity he had
      learned telegraphy when a boy, as he had learned many things, and, arrived
      at the scene of the accident, he sent messages and received them&mdash;by
      sound, not on paper as did the official operator, to the amazement and
      pride of the troop. Then, between caring for the injured in the accident,
      against the coming of the relief train, and nursing the sick operator
      through the dark moments of his dangerous illness, he passed a crisis of
      his own disease triumphantly; but not the last crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the first and so the second and third years passed in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PLEASE, I want to go, too, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim swung round and caught the child up in his arms. &ldquo;Say, how dare you
      call your father Jim&mdash;eh, tell me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what mummy calls you&mdash;it&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call her &lsquo;mummy&rsquo; because you do, and you mustn&rsquo;t call me Jim
      because she does&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo; The whimsical face lowered a little,
      then the rare and beautiful dark blue eyes raised slowly, shaded by the
      long lashes, and the voice said demurely, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy&mdash;Nancy,&rdquo; said a voice from the corner in reproof, mingled with
      suppressed laughter. &ldquo;Nancy, you musn&rsquo;t be saucy. You must say &lsquo;father&rsquo; to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mummy. I&rsquo;ll say father to&mdash;Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You imp&mdash;you imp of delight,&rdquo; said Jim, as he strained the dainty
      little lass to his breast, while she appeared interested in a wave of his
      black hair, which she curled around her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally came forwards with the little parcel of sandwiches she had been
      preparing, and put them in the saddle-bags lying on a chair at the door,
      in readiness for the journey Jim was about to make. Her eyes were
      glistening, and her face had a heightened colour. The three years which
      had passed since she married had touched her not at all to her
      disadvantage, rather to her profit. She looked not an hour older;
      motherhood had only added to her charm, lending it a delightful gravity.
      The prairie life had given a shining quality to her handsomeness, an air
      of depth and firmness, an exquisite health and clearness to the colour in
      her cheeks. Her step was as light as Nancy&rsquo;s, elastic and buoyant&mdash;a
      gliding motion which gave a sinuous grace to the movements of her body.
      There had also come into her eyes a vigilance such as deaf people possess,
      a sensitive observation imparting a deeper intelligence to the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the only change by which you could guess the story of her life.
      Her eyes were like the ears of an anxious mother who can never sleep till
      every child is abed; whose sense is quick to hear the faintest footstep
      without or within; and who, as years go on, and her children grow older
      and older, must still lie awake hearkening for the late footstep on the
      stair. In Sally&rsquo;s eyes was the story of the past three years: of love and
      temptation and struggle, of watchfulness and yearning and anxiety, of
      determination and an inviolable hope. Her eyes had a deeper look than that
      in Jim&rsquo;s. Now, as she gazed at him, the maternal spirit rose up from the
      great well of protectiveness in her and engulfed both husband and child.
      There was always something of the maternal in her eyes when she looked at
      Jim. He did not see it&mdash;he saw only the wonderful blue, and the
      humour which had helped him over such difficult places these past three
      years. In steadying and strengthening Jim&rsquo;s will, in developing him from
      his Southern indolence into Northern industry and sense of responsibility,
      John Appleton&rsquo;s warnings had rung in Sally&rsquo;s ears, and Freddy Hartzman&rsquo;s
      forceful and high-minded personality had passed before her eyes with an
      appeal powerful and stimulating; but always she came to the same upland of
      serene faith and white-hearted resolve; and Jim became dearer and dearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby had done much to brace her faith in the future and comfort her
      anxious present. The child had intelligence of a rare order. She would lie
      by the half-hour on the floor, turning over the leaves of a book without
      pictures, and, before she could speak, would read from the pages in a
      language all her own. She made a fairy world for herself, peopled by
      characters to whom she gave names, to whom she assigned curious attributes
      and qualities. They were as real to her as though flesh and blood, and she
      was never lonely, and never cried; and she had buried herself in her
      father&rsquo;s heart. She had drawn to her the roughest men in the troop, and
      for old Sewell, the grim sergeant, she had a specially warm place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can love me if you like,&rdquo; she had said to him at the very start, with
      the egotism of childhood; but made haste to add, &ldquo;because I love you,
      Gri-Gri.&rdquo; She called him Gri-Gri from the first, but they knew only long
      afterwards that &ldquo;gri-gri&rdquo; meant &ldquo;grey-grey,&rdquo; to signify that she called
      him after his grizzled hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she had been in the life-history of Sally and Jim they both knew. Jim
      regarded her with an almost superstitious feeling. Sally was his strength,
      his support, his inspiration, his bulwark of defence; Nancy was the charm
      he wore about his neck&mdash;his mascot, he called her. Once, when she was
      ill, he had suffered as he had never done before in his life. He could not
      sleep nor eat, and went about his duties like one in a dream. When his
      struggles against his enemy were fiercest, he kept saying over her name to
      himself, as though she could help him. Yet always it was Sally&rsquo;s hand he
      held in the darkest hours, in his brutal moments; for in this fight
      between appetite and will there are moments when only the animal seems to
      exist, and the soul disappears in the glare and gloom of the primal
      emotions. Nancy he called his &ldquo;lucky sixpence,&rdquo; but he called Sally his
      &ldquo;guinea-girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From first to last his whimsicality never deserted him. In his worst
      hours, some innate optimism and humour held him steady in his fight. It
      was not depression that possessed him at the worst, but the violence of an
      appetite most like a raging pain which men may endure with a smile upon
      their lips. He carried in his face the story of a conflict, the aftermath
      of bitter experience; and through all there pulsed the glow of experience.
      He had grown handsomer, and the graceful decision of his figure, the
      deliberate certainty of every action, heightened the force of a singular
      personality. As in the eyes of Sally, in his eyes was a long reflective
      look which told of things overcome, and yet of dangers present. His lips
      smiled often, but the eyes said: &ldquo;I have lived, I have seen, I have
      suffered, and I must suffer more. I have loved, I have been loved under
      the shadow of the sword. Happiness I have had, and golden hours, but not
      peace&mdash;never peace. My soul has need of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the greater, deeper experience of their lives, the more material side
      of existence had grown less and less to them. Their home was a model of
      simple comfort and some luxury, though Jim had insisted that Sally&rsquo;s
      income should not be spent, except upon the child, and should be saved for
      the child, their home being kept on his pay and on the tiny income left by
      his mother. With the help of an Indian girl, and a half-breed for outdoor
      work and fires and gardening, Sally had cared for the house herself.
      Ingenious and tasteful, with a gift for cooking and an educated hand, she
      had made her little home as pretty as their few possessions would permit.
      Refinement covered all, and three or four-score books were like so many
      friends to comfort her when Jim was away; like kind and genial neighbours
      when he was at home. From Browning she had written down in her long
      sliding handwriting, and hung up beneath Jim&rsquo;s looking-glass, the
      heartening and inspiring words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;One who never turned his back, but marched breast forward,
        Never doubted clouds would break,
     Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,
     Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,
        Sleep to wake.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They had lived above the sordid, and there was something in the nature of
      Jim&rsquo;s life to help them to it. He belonged to a small handful of men who
      had control over an empire, with an individual responsibility and
      influence not contained in the scope of their commissions. It was a matter
      of moral force and character, and of uniform, symbolical only of the great
      power behind; of the long arm of the State; of the insistence of the law,
      which did not rely upon force alone, but on the certainty of its
      administration. In such conditions the smallest brain was bound to expand,
      to take on qualities of judgment and temperateness which would never be
      developed in ordinary circumstances. In the case of Jim Templeton, who
      needed no stimulant to his intellect, but rather a steadying quality, a
      sense of proportion, the daily routine, the command of men, the diverse
      nature of his duties, half civil, half military, the personal appeals made
      on all sides by the people of the country for advice, for help, for
      settlement of disputes, for information which his well-instructed mind
      could give&mdash;all these modified the romantic brilliance of his
      intellect, made it and himself more human.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not come to him all at once. His intellect at first stood in his
      way. His love of paradox, his deep observation, his insight, all made him
      inherently satirical, though not cruelly so; but satire had become pure
      whimsicality at last; and he came to see that, on the whole, the world was
      imperfect, but also, on the whole, was moving towards perfection rather
      than imperfection. He grew to realise that what seemed so often weakness
      in men was tendency and idiosyncrasy rather than evil. And in the end he
      thought better of himself as he came to think better of all others. For he
      had thought less of all the world because he had thought so little of
      himself. He had overestimated his own faults, had made them into crimes in
      his own eyes, and, observing things in others of similar import, had
      become almost a cynic in intellect, while in heart he had remained, a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all that he had changed a great deal. His heart was still the heart of
      a boy, but his intellect had sobered, softened, ripened&mdash;even in this
      secluded and seemingly unimportant life; as Sally had said and hoped it
      would. Sally&rsquo;s conviction had been right. But the triumph was not yet
      achieved. She knew it. On occasion the tones of his voice told her, the
      look that came into his eyes proclaimed it to her, his feverishness and
      restlessness made it certain. How many a night had she thrown her arm over
      his shoulder, and sought his hand and held it while in the dark silence,
      wide-eyed, dry-lipped, and with a throat like fire he had held himself
      back from falling. There was liquor in the house&mdash;the fight would not
      have been a fight without it. She had determined that he should see his
      enemy and meet him in the plains and face him down; and he was never many
      feet away from his possible disaster. Yet for long over three years all
      had gone well. There was another year. Would he last out the course?
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the thought of the great stake for which she was playing in terms
      of currency, with the head of Jim&rsquo;s father on every note, was much with
      her. The amazing nature of the offer of five millions of dollars
      stimulated her imagination, roused her; gold coins are counters in the
      game of success, signs and tokens. Money alone could not have lured her;
      but rather what it represented&mdash;power, width of action, freedom to
      help when the heart prompted, machinery for carrying out large plans,
      ability to surround with advantage those whom we love. So, at first, while
      yet the memories of Washington were much with her, the appeal of the
      millions was strong. The gallant nature of the contest and the great stake
      braced her; she felt the blood quicken in her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, all through, the other thing really mastered her: the fixed idea that
      Jim must be saved. As it deepened, the other life that she had lived
      became like the sports in which we shared when children, full of vivacious
      memory, shining with impulse and the stir of life, but not to be repeated&mdash;days
      and deeds outgrown. So the light of one idea shone in her face. Yet she
      was intensely human too; and if her eyes had not been set on the greater
      glory, the other thought might have vulgarised her mind, made her end and
      goal sordid&mdash;the descent of a nature rather than its ascension.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Nancy came, the lesser idea, the stake, took on a new importance, for
      now it seemed to her that it was her duty to secure for the child its
      rightful heritage. Then Jim, too, appeared in a new light, as one who
      could never fulfil himself unless working through the natural channels of
      his birth, inheritance, and upbringing. Jim, drunken and unreliable, with
      broken will and fighting to find himself&mdash;the waste places were for
      him, until he was the master of his will and emotions. Once however,
      secure in ability to control himself, with cleansed brain and purpose
      defined, the widest field would still be too narrow for his talents&mdash;and
      the five, yes, the fifty millions of his father must be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never repented having married Jim; but twice in those three years
      she had broken down and wept as though her heart would break. There were
      times when Jim&rsquo;s nerves were shaken in his struggle against the unseen
      foe, and he had spoken to her querulously, almost sharply. Yet in her
      tears there was no reproach for him, rather for herself&mdash;the fear
      that she might lose her influence over him, that she could not keep him
      close to her heart, that he might drift away from her in the commonplaces
      and monotony of work and domestic life. Everything so depended on her
      being to him not only the one woman for whom he cared, but the woman
      without whom he could care for nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, give me his love,&rdquo; she had prayed. &ldquo;Let me keep it yet a
      little while. For his sake, not for my own, let me have the power to hold
      his love. Make my mind always quiet, and let me blow neither hot nor cold.
      Help me to keep my temper sweet and cheerful, so that he will find the
      room empty where I am not, and his footsteps will quicken when he comes to
      the door. Not for my sake, dear God, but for his, or my heart will break&mdash;it
      will break unless Thou dost help me to hold him. O Lord, keep me from
      tears; make my face happy that I may be goodly to his eyes, and forgive
      the selfishness of a poor woman who has little, and would keep her little
      and cherish it, for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twice had she poured out her heart so, in the agony of her fear that she
      should lose favour in Jim&rsquo;s sight&mdash;she did not know how alluring she
      was, in spite of the constant proofs offered her. She had had her will
      with all who came her way, from governor to Indian brave. Once, in a
      journey they had made far north, soon after they came, she had stayed at a
      Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s post for some days, while there came news of
      restlessness among the Indians, because of lack of food, and Jim had gone
      farther north to steady the tribes, leaving her with the factor and his
      wife and a halfbreed servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she and the factor&rsquo;s wife were alone in the yard of the post one
      day, an Indian&mdash;chief, Arrowhead, in warpaint and feathers, entered
      suddenly, brandishing a long knife. He had been drinking, and there was
      danger in his black eyes. With a sudden inspiration she came forward
      quickly, nodded and smiled to him, and then pointed to a grindstone
      standing in the corner of the yard. As she did so, she saw Indians
      crowding into the gate armed with knives, guns, bows, and arrows. She
      beckoned to Arrowhead, and he followed her to the grindstone. She poured
      some water on the wheel and began to turn it, nodding at the now impassive
      Indian to begin. Presently he nodded also, and put his knife on the stone.
      She kept turning steadily, singing to herself the while, as with anxiety
      she saw the Indians drawing closer and closer in from the gate. Faster and
      faster she turned, and at last the Indian lifted his knife from the stone.
      She reached out her hand with simulated interest, felt the edge with her
      thumb, the Indian looking darkly at her the while. Presently, after
      feeling the edge himself, he bent over the stone again, and she went on
      turning the wheel still singing softly. At last he stopped again and felt
      the edge. With a smile which showed her fine white teeth, she said, &ldquo;Is
      that for me?&rdquo; making a significant sign across her throat at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Indian looked at her grimly, then slowly shook his head in
      negation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go hunt Yellow Hawk to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I go fight; I like marry you
      when I come back. How!&rdquo; he said and turned away towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his braves held back, the blackness of death in their looks. He
      saw. &ldquo;My knife is sharp,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The woman is brave. She shall live&mdash;go
      and fight Yellow Hawk, or starve and die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Divining their misery, their hunger, and the savage thought that had come
      to them, Sally had whispered to the factor&rsquo;s wife to bring food, and the
      woman now came running out with two baskets full, and returned for more.
      Sally ran forward among the Indians and put the food into their hands.
      With grunts of satisfaction they seized what she gave, and thrust it into
      their mouths, squatting on the ground. Arrowhead looked on stern and
      immobile, but when at last she and the factor&rsquo;s wife sat down before the
      braves with confidence and an air of friendliness, he sat down also; yet,
      famished as he was, he would not touch the food. At last Sally, realising
      his proud defiance of hunger, offered him a little lump of pemmican and a
      biscuit, and with a grunt he took it from her hands and ate it. Then, at
      his command a fire was lit, the pipe of peace was brought out, and Sally
      and the factor&rsquo;s wife touched their lips to it, and passed it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      So was a new treaty of peace and loyalty made with Arrowhead and his tribe
      by a woman without fear, whose life had seemed not worth a minute&rsquo;s
      purchase; and, as the sun went down, Arrowhead and his men went forth to
      make war upon Yellow Hawk beside the Nettigon River. In this wise had her
      influence spread in the land.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        .......................
</pre>
    <p>
      Standing now with the child in his arms and his wife looking at him with a
      shining moisture of the eyes, Jim laughed outright. There came upon him a
      sudden sense of power, of aggressive force&mdash;the will to do. Sally
      understood, and came and laughingly grasped his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim,&rdquo; she said playfully, &ldquo;you are getting muscles like steel. You
      hadn&rsquo;t these when you were colonel of the Kentucky Carbineers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I need them now,&rdquo; he said, smiling, and with the child still in
      his arms drew her to a window looking northward. As far as the eye could
      see, nothing but snow, like a blanket spread over the land. Here and there
      in the wide expanse a tree silhouetted against the sky, a tracery of
      eccentric beauty, and off in the far distance a solitary horseman riding
      towards the postriding hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was root, hog, or die with me, Sally,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I rooted ...
      I wonder&mdash;that fellow on the horse&mdash;I have a feeling about him.
      See, he&rsquo;s been riding hard and long-you can tell by the way the horse
      drops his legs. He sags a bit himself.... But isn&rsquo;t it beautiful, all that
      out there&mdash;the real quintessence of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The air was full of delicate particles of frost on which the sun sparkled,
      and though there was neither bird nor insect, nor animal, nor stir of
      leaf, nor swaying branch or waving grass, life palpitated in the air,
      energy sang its song in the footstep that crunched the frosty ground, that
      broke the crusted snow; it was in the delicate wind that stirred the flag
      by the barracks away to the left; hope smiled in the wide prospect over
      which the thrilling, bracing air trembled. Sally had chosen right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a big thought when you brought me here, guinea-girl,&rdquo; he added
      presently. &ldquo;We are going to win out here&rdquo;&mdash;he set the child down&mdash;&ldquo;you
      and I and this lucky sixpence.&rdquo; He took up his short fur coat. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll
      win, honey.&rdquo; Then, with a brooding look in his face, he added:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;&lsquo;The end comes as came the beginning,
        And shadows fail into the past;
        And the goal, is it not worth the winning,
        If it brings us but home at the last?

       &ldquo;&lsquo;While far through the pain of waste places
        We tread, &lsquo;tis a blossoming rod
        That drives us to grace from disgraces,
        From the fens to the gardens of God!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He paused reflectively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange that this life up here makes you
      feel that you must live a bigger life still, that this is only the wide
      porch to the great labour-house&mdash;it makes you want to do things.
      Well, we&rsquo;ve got to win the stake first,&rdquo; he added with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stake is a big one, Jim&mdash;bigger than you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and her and me&mdash;me that was in the gutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the gutter, dadsie?&rdquo; asked Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gutter&mdash;the gutter is where the dish-water goes, midget,&rdquo; he
      answered with a dry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d like to be in the gutter,&rdquo; Nancy said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to get used to it first, miss,&rdquo; answered Jim. Suddenly Sally
      laid both hands on Jim&rsquo;s shoulders and looked him in the eyes. &ldquo;You must
      win the stake Jim. Think&mdash;now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid a hand on the head of the child. He did not know that he was
      playing for a certain five millions, perhaps fifty millions, of dollars.
      She had never told him of his father&rsquo;s offer. He was fighting only for
      salvation, for those he loved, for freedom. As they stood there, the
      conviction had come upon her that they had come to the last battle-field,
      that this journey which Jim now must take would decide all, would give
      them perfect peace or lifelong pain. The shadow of battle was over them,
      but he had no foreboding, no premonition; he had never been so full of
      spirits and life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her adjuration Jim replied by burying his face in her golden hair, and
      he whispered: &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve done near four years, my girl. I think I&rsquo;m all
      right now&mdash;I think. This last six months, it&rsquo;s been easy&mdash;pretty
      fairly easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four months more, only four months more&mdash;God be good to us!&rdquo; she
      said with a little gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he held out for four months more, the first great stage in their life&mdash;journey
      would be passed, the stake won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a woman get an awful fall once,&rdquo; Jim said suddenly. &ldquo;Her bones were
      broken in twelve places, and there wasn&rsquo;t a spot on her body without
      injury. They set and fixed up every broken bone except one. It was split
      down. They didn&rsquo;t dare perform the operation; she couldn&rsquo;t stand it. There
      was a limit to pain, and she had reached the boundary. Two years went by,
      and she got better every way, but inside her leg those broken pieces of
      bone were rubbing against each other. She tried to avoid the inevitable
      operation, but nature said, &lsquo;You must do it, or die in the end.&rsquo; She
      yielded. Then came the long preparations for the operation. Her heart
      shrank, her mind got tortured. She&rsquo;d suffered too much. She pulled herself
      together, and said, &lsquo;I must conquer this shrinking body of mine, by my
      will. How shall I do it?&rsquo; Something within her said, &lsquo;Think and do for
      others. Forget yourself.&rsquo; And so, as they got her ready for her torture,
      she visited hospitals, agonised cripple as she was, and smiled and talked
      to the sick and broken, telling them of her own miseries endured and
      dangers faced, of the boundary of human suffering almost passed; and so
      she got her courage for her own trial. And she came out all right in the
      end. Well, that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve felt sometimes. But I&rsquo;m ready for my
      operation now whenever it comes, and it&rsquo;s coming, I know. Let it come when
      it must.&rdquo; He smiled. There came a knock at the door, and presently Sewell
      entered. &ldquo;The Commissioner wishes you to come over, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just coming, Sewell. Is all ready for the start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s ready, sir, but there&rsquo;s to be a change of orders.
      Something&rsquo;s happened&mdash;a bad job up in the Cree country, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Jim was in the Commissioner&rsquo;s office. The murder of a
      Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s man had been committed in the Cree country. The
      stranger whom Jim and Sally had seen riding across the plains had brought
      the news for thirty miles, word of the murder having been carried from
      point to point. The Commissioner was uncertain what to do, as the Crees
      were restless through want of food and the absence of game, and a force
      sent to capture Arrowhead, the chief who had committed the murder, might
      precipitate trouble. Jim solved the problem by offering to go alone and
      bring the chief into the post. It was two hundred miles to the Cree
      encampment, and the journey had its double dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another officer was sent on the expedition for which Jim had been
      preparing, and he made ready to go upon his lonely duty. His wife did not
      know till three days after he had gone what the nature of his mission was.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim made his journey in good weather with his faithful dogs alone, and
      came into the camp of the Crees armed with only a revolver. If he had gone
      with ten men, there would have been an instant melee, in which he would
      have lost his life. This is what the chief had expected, had prepared for;
      but Jim was more formidable alone, with power far behind him which could
      come with force and destroy the tribe, if resistance was offered, than
      with fifty men. His tongue had a gift of terse and picturesque speech,
      powerful with a people who had the gift of imagination. With five hundred
      men ready to turn him loose in the plains without dogs or food, he carried
      himself with a watchful coolness and complacent determination which got
      home to their minds with great force.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours the struggle for the murderer went on, a struggle of mind over
      inferior mind and matter. Arrowhead was a chief whose will had never been
      crossed by his own people, and to master that will by a superior will, to
      hold back the destructive force which, to the ignorant minds of the
      braves, was only a natural force of defence, meant a task needing more
      than authority behind it. For the very fear of that authority put in
      motion was an incentive to present resistance to stave off the day of
      trouble. The faces that surrounded Jim were thin with hunger, and the
      murder that had been committed by the chief had, as its origin, the
      foolish replies of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s man to their demand for
      supplies. Arrowhead had killed him with his own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jim Templeton was of a different calibre. Although he had not been
      told it, he realised that, indirectly, hunger was the cause of the crime
      and might easily become the cause of another; for their tempers were
      sharper even than their appetites. Upon this he played; upon this he made
      an exhortation to the chief. He assumed that Arrowhead had become violent,
      because of his people&rsquo;s straits, that Arrowhead&rsquo;s heart yearned for his
      people and would make sacrifice for them. Now, if Arrowhead came quietly,
      he would see that supplies of food were sent at once, and that
      arrangements were made to meet the misery of their situation. Therefore,
      if Arrowhead came freely, he would have so much in his favour before his
      judges; if he would not come quietly, then he must be brought by force;
      and if they raised a hand to prevent it, then destruction would fall upon
      all&mdash;all save the women and children. The law must be obeyed. They
      might try to resist the law through him, but, if violence was shown, he
      would first kill Arrowhead, and then destruction would descend like a wind
      out of the north, darkness would swallow them, and their bones would cover
      the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ended his words a young brave sprang forwards with hatchet raised.
      Jim&rsquo;s revolver slipped down into his palm from his sleeve, and a bullet
      caught the brave in the lifted arm. The hatchet dropped to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jim&rsquo;s eyes blazed, and he turned a look of anger on the chief, his
      face pale and hard, as he said: &ldquo;The stream rises above the banks; come
      with me, chief, or all will drown. I am master, and I speak. Ye are hungry
      because ye are idle. Ye call the world yours, yet ye will not stoop to
      gather from the earth the fruits of the earth. Ye sit idle in the summer,
      and women and children die round you when winter comes. Because the game
      is gone, ye say. Must the world stand still because a handful of Crees
      need a hunting-ground? Must the makers of cities and the wonders of the
      earth, who fill the land with plenty&mdash;must they stand far off,
      because the Crees and their chief would wander over millions of acres, for
      each man a million, when by a hundred, ay, by ten, each white man would
      live in plenty, and make the land rejoice. See. Here is the truth. When
      the Great Spirit draws the game away so that the hunting is poor, ye sit
      down and fill your hearts with murder, and in the blackness of your
      thoughts kill my brother. Idle and shiftless and evil ye are, while the
      earth cries out to give you of its plenty, a great harvest from a little
      seed, if ye will but dig and plant, and plough and sow and reap, and lend
      your backs to toil. Now hear and heed. The end is come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this once ye shall be fed&mdash;by the blood of my heart, ye shall be
      fed! And another year ye shall labour, and get the fruits of your labour,
      and not stand waiting, as it were, till a fish shall pass the spear, or a
      stag water at your door, that ye may slay and eat. The end is come, ye
      idle men. O chief, harken! One of your braves would have slain me, even as
      you slew my brother&mdash;he one, and you a thousand. Speak to your people
      as I have spoken, and then come and answer for the deed done by your hand.
      And this I say that right shall be done between men and men. Speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim had made his great effort, and not without avail. Arrowhead rose
      slowly, the cloud gone out of his face, and spoke to his people, bidding
      them wait in peace until food came, and appointing his son chief in his
      stead until his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white man speaks truth, and I will go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall return,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;if it be written so upon the leaves of the Tree of Life; and
      if it be not so written, I shall fade like a mist, and the tepees will
      know me not again. The days of my youth are spent, and my step no longer
      springs from the ground. I shuffle among the grass and the fallen leaves,
      and my eyes scarce know the stag from the doe. The white man is master&mdash;if
      he wills it we shall die, if he wills it we shall live. And this was ever
      so. It is in the tale of our people. One tribe ruled, and the others were
      their slaves. If it is written on the leaves of the Tree of Life that the
      white man rule us for ever, then it shall be so. I have spoken. Now,
      behold I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim had conquered, and together they sped away with the dogs through the
      sweet-smelling spruce woods where every branch carried a cloth of white,
      and the only sound heard was the swish of a blanket of snow as it fell to
      the ground from the wide webs of green, or a twig snapped under the load
      it bore. Peace brooded in the silent and comforting forest, and Jim and
      Arrowhead, the Indian ever ahead, swung along, mile after mile, on their
      snow-shoes, emerging at last upon the wide white prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred miles of sun and fair weather, sleeping at night in the open in
      a trench dug in the snow, no fear in the thoughts of Jim, nor evil in the
      heart of the heathen man. There had been moments of watchfulness, of
      uncertainty, on Jim&rsquo;s part, the first few hours of the first night after
      they left the Cree reservation; but the conviction speedily came to Jim
      that all was well; for the chief slept soundly from the moment he lay down
      in his blankets between the dogs. Then Jim went to sleep as in his own
      bed, and, waking, found Arrowhead lighting a fire from a little load of
      sticks from the sledges. And between murderer and captor there sprang up
      the companionship of the open road which brings all men to a certain land
      of faith and understanding, unless they are perverted and vile. There was
      no vileness in Arrowhead. There were no handcuffs on his hands, no sign of
      captivity; they two ate out of the same dish, drank from the same basin,
      broke from the same bread. The crime of Arrowhead, the gallows waiting for
      him, seemed very far away. They were only two silent travellers, sharing
      the same hardship, helping to give material comfort to each other&mdash;in
      the inevitable democracy of those far places, where small things are not
      great nor great things small; where into men&rsquo;s hearts comes the knowledge
      of the things that matter; where, from the wide, starry sky, from the
      august loneliness, and the soul of the life which has brooded there for
      untold generations, God teaches the values of this world and the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hundred miles of sun and fair weather, and then fifty miles of bitter,
      aching cold, with nights of peril from the increasing chill, so that Jim
      dared not sleep lest he should never wake again, but die benumbed and
      exhausted. Yet Arrowhead slept through all. Day after day so, and then ten
      miles of storm such as come only to the vast barrens of the northlands;
      and woe to the traveller upon whom the icy wind and the blinding snow
      descended! Woe came upon Jim Templeton and Arrowhead, the heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the awful struggle between man and nature that followed, the captive
      became the leader. The craft of the plains, the inherent instinct, the
      feeling which was more than eyesight became the only hope. One whole day
      to cover ten miles&mdash;an endless path of agony, in which Jim went down
      again and again, but came up blinded by snow and drift, and cut as with
      lashes by the angry wind. At the end of the ten miles was a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
      Company&rsquo;s post and safety; and through ten hours had the two struggled
      towards it, going off at tangents, circling on their own tracks; but the
      Indian, by an instinct as sure as the needle to the pole, getting the
      direction to the post again, in the moments of direst peril and
      uncertainty. To Jim the world became a sea of maddening forces which
      buffeted him; a whirlpool of fire in which his brain was tortured, his
      mind was shrivelled up; a vast army rending itself, each man against the
      other. It was a purgatory of music, broken by discords; and then at last&mdash;how
      sweet it all was, after the eternity of misery&mdash;&ldquo;Church bells and
      voices low,&rdquo; and Sally singing to him, Nancy&rsquo;s voice calling! Then,
      nothing but sleep&mdash;sleep, a sinking down millions of miles in an
      ether of drowsiness which thrilled him; and after&mdash;no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      None who has suffered up to the limit of what the human body and soul may
      bear can remember the history of those distracted moments when the
      struggle became one between the forces in nature and the forces in man,
      between agonised body and smothered mind, yet with the divine intelligence
      of the created being directing, even though subconsciously, the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Arrowhead found the post in the mad storm he could never have told.
      Yet he found it, with Jim unconscious on the sledge and with limbs frozen,
      all the dogs gone but two, the leathers over the Indian&rsquo;s shoulders as he
      fell against the gate of the post with a shrill cry that roused the factor
      and his people within, together with Sergeant Sewell, who had been sent
      out from headquarters to await Jim&rsquo;s arrival there. It was Sewell&rsquo;s hand
      which first felt Jim&rsquo;s heart and pulse, and found that there was still
      life left, even before it could be done by the doctor from headquarters,
      who had come to visit a sick man at the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours they worked with snow upon the frozen limbs to bring back life
      and consciousness. Consciousness came at last with half delirium, half
      understanding; as emerging from the passing sleep of anaesthetics, the eye
      sees things and dimly registers them, before the brain has set them in any
      relation to life or comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was roused at last, and the doctor presently held to his lips a
      glass of brandy. Then from infinite distance Jim&rsquo;s understanding returned;
      the mind emerged, but not wholly, from the chaos in which it was
      travelling. His eyes stood out in eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy! brandy!&rdquo; he said hungrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an oath Sewell snatched the glass from the doctor&rsquo;s hand, put it on
      the table, then stooped to Jim&rsquo;s ear and said hoarsely: &ldquo;Remember&mdash;Nancy.
      For God&rsquo;s sake, sir, don&rsquo;t drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim&rsquo;s head fell back, the fierce light went out of his eyes, the face
      became greyer and sharper. &ldquo;Sally&mdash;Nancy&mdash;Nancy,&rdquo; he whispered,
      and his fingers clutched vaguely at the quilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have brandy or he will die. The system is pumped out. He must be
      revived,&rdquo; said the doctor. He reached again for the glass of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim understood now. He was on the borderland between life and death; his
      feet were at the brink. &ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;brandy, no!&rdquo; he moaned.
      &ldquo;Sally-Sally, kiss me,&rdquo; he said faintly, from the middle world in which he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, the broth!&rdquo; said Sewell to the factor, who had been preparing it.
      &ldquo;Quick, while there&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo; He stooped and called into Jim&rsquo;s ear:
      &ldquo;For the love of God, wake up, sir. They&rsquo;re coming&mdash;they&rsquo;re both
      coming&mdash;Nancy&rsquo;s coming. They&rsquo;ll soon be here.&rdquo; What matter that he
      lied, a life was at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim&rsquo;s eyes opened again. The doctor was standing with the brandy in his
      hand. Half madly Jim reached out. &ldquo;I must live until they come,&rdquo; he cried;
      &ldquo;the brandy&mdash;give it me! Give it&mdash;ah, no, no, I must not!&rdquo; he
      added, gasping, his lips trembling, his hands shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sewell held the broth to his lips. He drank a little, yet his face became
      greyer and greyer; a bluish tinge spread about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing else, sir?&rdquo; asked Sewell in despair. The doctor put down
      the brandy, went quickly to his medicine-case, dropped into a glass some
      liquid from a phial, came over again, and poured a little between the
      lips; then a little more, as Jim&rsquo;s eyes opened again; and at last every
      drop in the glass trickled down the sinewy throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently as they watched him the doctor said: &ldquo;It will not do. He must
      have brandy. It has life-food in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim understood the words. He knew that if he drank the brandy the chances
      against his future were terrible. He had made his vow, and he must keep
      it. Yet the thirst was on him; his enemy had him by the throat again, was
      dragging him down. Though his body was so cold, his throat was on fire.
      But in the extremity of his strength his mind fought on&mdash;fought on,
      growing weaker every moment. He was having his last fight. They watched
      him with an aching anxiety, and there was anger in the doctor&rsquo;s face. He
      had no patience with these forces arrayed against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the doctor whispered to Sewell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use; he must have the
      brandy, or he can&rsquo;t live an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sewell weakened; the tears fell down his rough, hard cheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll ruin
      him-it&rsquo;s ruin or death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust a little more in God, and in the man&rsquo;s strength. Let us give him
      the chance. Force it down his throat&mdash;he&rsquo;s not responsible,&rdquo; said the
      physician, to whom saving life was more than all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there appeared at the bedside Arrowhead, gaunt and weak, his face
      swollen, the skin of it broken by the whips of storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my brother,&rdquo; he said, and, stooping, laid both hands, which he had
      held before the fire for a long time, on Jim&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Take his feet, his
      hands, his, legs, and his head in your hands,&rdquo; he said to them all. &ldquo;Life
      is in us; we will give him life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down and kept both hands on Jim&rsquo;s heart, while the others, even
      the doctor, awed by his act, did as they were bidden. &ldquo;Shut your eyes. Let
      your life go into him. Think of him, and him alone. Now!&rdquo; said Arrowhead
      in a strange voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He murmured, and continued murmuring, his body drawing closer and closer
      to Jim&rsquo;s body, while in the deep silence, broken only by the chanting of
      his low monotonous voice, the others pressed Jim&rsquo;s hands and head and feet
      and legs&mdash;six men under the command of a heathen murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed. The colour came back to Jim&rsquo;s face, the skin of his
      hands filled up, they ceased twitching, his pulse got stronger, his eyes
      opened with a new light in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m living, anyhow,&rdquo; he said at last with a faint smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&mdash;broth,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fight was won, and Arrowhead, the pagan murderer, drew over to the
      fire and crouched down beside it, his back to the bed, impassive and
      still. They brought him a bowl of broth and bread, which he drank slowly,
      and placed the empty bowl between his knees. He sat there through the
      night, though they tried to make him lie down.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the light came in at the windows, Sewell touched him on the shoulder,
      and said: &ldquo;He is sleeping now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear my brother breathe,&rdquo; answered Arrowhead. &ldquo;He will live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All night he had listened, and had heard Jim&rsquo;s breath as only a man who
      has lived in waste places can hear. &ldquo;He will live. What I take with one
      hand I give with the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had taken the life of the factor; he had given Jim his life. And when
      he was tried three months later for murder, some one else said this for
      him, and the hearts of all, judge and jury, were so moved they knew not
      what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arrowhead was never sentenced, for, at the end of the first day&rsquo;s
      trial, he lay down to sleep and never waked again. He was found the next
      morning still and cold, and there was clasped in his hands a little doll
      which Nancy had given him on one of her many visits to the prison during
      her father&rsquo;s long illness. They found a piece of paper in his belt with
      these words in the Cree language: &ldquo;With my hands on his heart at the post
      I gave him the life that was in me, saving but a little until now.
      Arrowhead, the chief, goes to find life again by the well at the root of
      the tree. How!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day that Arrowhead made his journey to &ldquo;the well at
      the root of the tree&rdquo; a stranger knocked at the door of Captain
      Templeton&rsquo;s cottage; then, without awaiting admittance, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was sitting with Nancy on his knee, her head against his shoulder,
      Sally at his side, her face alight with some inner joy. Before the knock
      came to the door Jim had just said, &ldquo;Why do your eyes shine so, Sally?
      What&rsquo;s in your mind?&rdquo; She had been about to answer, to say to him what had
      been swelling her heart with pride, though she had not meant to tell him
      what he had forgotten&mdash;not till midnight. But the figure that entered
      the room, a big man with deep-set eyes, a man of power who had carried
      everything before him in the battle of life, answered for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have won the stake, Jim,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;You and she
      have won the stake, and I&rsquo;ve brought it&mdash;brought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before they could speak he placed in Sally&rsquo;s hands bonds for five million
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim&mdash;Jim, my son!&rdquo; he burst out. Then, suddenly, he sank into a
      chair and, putting his head in his hands, sobbed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, but I&rsquo;m proud of you&mdash;speak to me, Jim. You&rsquo;ve broken me
      up.&rdquo; He was ashamed of his tears, but he could not wipe them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, dear old man!&rdquo; said Jim, and put his hands on the broad
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally knelt down beside him, took both the great hands from the
      tear-stained face, and laid them against her cheek. But presently she put
      Nancy on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you to cry,&rdquo; the child said softly; &ldquo;but to-day I cried too,
      &lsquo;cause my Indian man is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man could not speak, but he put his cheek down to hers. After a
      minute, &ldquo;Oh, but she&rsquo;s worth ten times that!&rdquo; he said as Sally came close
      to him with the bundle he had thrust into her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s five million dollars&mdash;for Nancy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Five-million&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stake, Jim,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;If you did not drink for four years&mdash;never
      touched a drop&mdash;we were to have five million dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told him, then&mdash;you never told him that?&rdquo; asked the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted him to win without it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If he won, he would be the
      stronger; if he lost, it would not be so hard for him to bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew her down and kissed her cheek. He chuckled, though the
      tears were still in his eyes. &ldquo;You are a wonder&mdash;the tenth wonder of
      the world!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim stood staring at the bundle in Nancy&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Five millions&mdash;five
      million dollars!&rdquo;&mdash;he kept saying to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said Nancy&rsquo;s worth ten times that, Jim.&rdquo; The old man caught his hand
      and pressed it. &ldquo;But it was a damned near thing, I tell you,&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;They tried to break me and my railways and my bank. I had to fight the
      combination, and there was one day when I hadn&rsquo;t that five million dollars
      there, nor five. Jim, they tried to break the old man. And if they&rsquo;d
      broken me, they&rsquo;d have made me out a scoundrel to her&mdash;to this wife
      of yours who risked everything for both of us, for both of us, Jim; for
      she&rsquo;d given up the world to save you, and she was playing like a soul in
      Hell for Heaven. If they&rsquo;d broken me, I&rsquo;d never have lifted my head again.
      When things were at their worst I played to save that five millions,&mdash;her
      stake and mine,&mdash;I played for that. I fought for it as a man fights
      his way out of a burning house. And I won&mdash;I won. And it was by
      fighting for that five millions I saved fifty&mdash;fifty millions, son.
      They didn&rsquo;t break the old man, Jim. They didn&rsquo;t break him&mdash;not much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are giants in the world still,&rdquo; said Jim, his own eyes full. He
      knew now his father and himself, and he knew the meaning of all the bitter
      and misspent life of the old days. He and his father were on a level of
      understanding at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a giant?&rdquo; asked Nancy, peering up into her grandfather&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man laughed, then sighed. &ldquo;Perhaps I was once, more or less, my
      dear&mdash;&rdquo; saying to her what he meant for the other two. &ldquo;Perhaps I
      was; but I&rsquo;ve finished. I&rsquo;m through. I&rsquo;ve had my last fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his son. &ldquo;I pass the game on to you, Jim. You can do it. I
      knew you could do it as the reports came in this year. I&rsquo;ve had a
      detective up here for four years. I had to do it. It was the devil in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to carry on the game, Jim; I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;ll stay home and potter
      about. I want to go back to Kentucky, and build up the old place, and take
      care of it a bit-your mother always loved it. I&rsquo;d like to have it as it
      was when she was there long ago. But I&rsquo;ll be ready to help you when I&rsquo;m
      wanted, understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to run things&mdash;your colossal schemes? You think&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think. I&rsquo;m old enough to know.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      WHEN THE SWALLOWS HOMEWARD FLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The arrogant sun had stalked away into the evening, trailing behind him
      banners of gold and crimson, and a swift twilight was streaming over the
      land. As the sun passed, the eyes of two men on a high hill followed it,
      and the look of one was like a light in a window to a lost traveller. It
      had in it the sense of home and the tale of a journey done. Such a journey
      this man had made as few have ever attempted, and fewer accomplished. To
      the farthermost regions of snow and ice, where the shoulder of a continent
      juts out into the northwestern Arctic seas, he had travelled on foot and
      alone, save for his dogs, and for Indian guides, who now and then
      shepherded him from point to point. The vast ice-hummocks had been his
      housing, pemmican, the raw flesh of fish, and even the fat and oil of
      seals had been his food. Ever and ever through long months the everlasting
      white glitter of the snow and ice, ever and ever the cold stars, the
      cloudless sky, the moon at full, or swung like a white sickle in the sky
      to warn him that his life must be mown like grass. At night to sleep in a
      bag of fur and wool, by day the steely wind, or the air shaking with a
      filmy powder of frost; while the illimitably distant sun made the tiny
      flakes sparkle like silver&mdash;a poudre day, when the face and hands are
      most like to be frozen, and all so still and white and passionless, yet
      aching with energy. Hundreds upon hundreds of miles that endless trail
      went winding to the farthest North-west. No human being had ever trod its
      lengths before, though Indians or a stray Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company man had
      made journeys over part of it during the years that have passed since
      Prince Rupert sent his adventurers to dot that northern land with posts
      and forts, and trace fine arteries of civilisation through the wastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where this man had gone none other had been of white men from the Western
      lands, though from across the wide Pacific, from the Eastern world,
      adventurers and exiles had once visited what is now known as the Yukon
      Valley. So this man, browsing in the library of his grandfather, an
      Eastern scholar, had come to know; and for love of adventure, and because
      of the tale of a valley of gold and treasure to be had, and because he had
      been ruined by bad investments, he had made a journey like none ever
      essayed before. And on his way up to those regions, where the veil before
      the face of God is very thin and fine, and men&rsquo;s hearts glow within them,
      where there was no oasis save the unguessed deposit of a great human dream
      that his soul could feel, the face of a girl had haunted him. Her voice&mdash;so
      sweet a voice that it rang like muffled silver in his ears, till, in the
      everlasting theatre of the Pole, the stars seemed to repeat it through
      millions of echoing hills, growing softer and softer as the frost hushed
      it to his ears-had said to him late and early, &ldquo;You must come back with
      the swallows.&rdquo; Then she had sung a song which had been like a fire in his
      heart, not alone because of the words of it, but because of the soul in
      her voice, and it had lain like a coverlet on his heart to keep it warm:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Adieu! The sun goes awearily down,
        The mist creeps up o&rsquo;er the sleepy town,
        The white sail bends to the shuddering mere,
        And the reapers have reaped and the night is here.

        Adieu! And the years are a broken song,
        The right grows weak in the strife with wrong,
        The lilies of love have a crimson stain,
        And the old days never will come again.

        Adieu! Where the mountains afar are dim
        &lsquo;Neath the tremulous tread of the seraphim,
        Shall not our querulous hearts prevail,
        That have prayed for the peace of the Holy Grail.

        Adieu! Sometime shall the veil between
        The things that are and that might have been
        Be folded back for our eyes to see,
        And the meaning of all shall be clear to me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It had been but an acquaintance of five days while he fitted out for his
      expedition, but in this brief time it had sunk deep into his mind that
      life was now a thing to cherish, and that he must indeed come back; though
      he had left England caring little if, in the peril and danger of his
      quest, he ever returned. He had been indifferent to his fate till he came
      to the Valley of the Saskatchewan, to the town lying at the foot of the
      maple hill beside the great northern stream, and saw the girl whose life
      was knit with the far north, whose mother&rsquo;s heart was buried in the great
      wastes where Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s expedition was lost; for her husband had
      been one of the ill-fated if not unhappy band of lovers of that
      civilisation for which they had risked all and lost all save immortality.
      Hither the two had come after he had been cast away on the icy plains, and
      as the settlement had crept north, had gone north with it, always on the
      outer edge of house and field, ever stepping northward. Here, with small
      income but high hearts and quiet souls, they had lived and laboured. And
      when this newcomer from the old land set his face northward to an unknown
      destination, the two women had prayed as the mother did in the old days
      when the daughter was but a babe at her knee, and it was not yet certain
      that Franklin and his men had been cast away for ever. Something in him,
      his great height, his strength of body, his clear, meditative eyes, his
      brave laugh, reminded her of him&mdash;her husband&mdash;who, like Sir
      Humphrey Gilbert, had said that it mattered little where men did their
      duty, since God was always near to take or leave as it was His will. When
      Bickersteth went, it was as though one they had known all their lives had
      passed; and the woman knew also that a new thought had been sown in her
      daughter&rsquo;s mind, a new door opened in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had returned. He was now looking down into the valley where the
      village lay. Far, far over, two days&rsquo; march away, he could see the cluster
      of houses, and the glow of the sun on the tin spire of the little Mission
      Church where he had heard the girl and her mother sing, till the hearts of
      all were swept by feeling and ravished by the desire for &ldquo;the peace of the
      Holy Grail.&rdquo; The village was, in truth, but a day&rsquo;s march away from him,
      but he was not alone, and the journey could not be hastened. Beside him,
      his eyes also upon the sunset and the village, was a man in a costume
      half-trapper, half-Indian, with bushy grey beard and massive frame, and a
      distant, sorrowful look, like that of one whose soul was tuned to past
      suffering. As he sat, his head sunk on his breast, his elbow resting on a
      stump of pine&mdash;the token of a progressive civilisation&mdash;his chin
      upon his hand, he looked like the figure of Moses made immortal by Michael
      Angelo. But his strength was not like that of the man beside him, who was
      thirty years younger. When he walked, it was as one who had no
      destination, who had no haven towards which to travel, who journeyed as
      one to whom the world is a wilderness, and one tent or one hut is the same
      as another, and none is home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like two ships meeting hull to hull on the wide seas, where a few miles of
      water will hide them from each other, whose ports are thousands of miles
      apart, whose courses are not the same, they two had met, the elder man,
      sick and worn, and near to death, in the poor hospitality of an Indian&rsquo;s
      tepee. John Bickersteth had nursed the old man back to strength, and had
      brought him southward with him&mdash;a silent companion, who spoke in
      monosyllables, who had no conversation at all of the past, and little of
      the present; but who was a woodsman and an Arctic traveller of the most
      expert kind; who knew by instinct where the best places for shelter and
      for sleeping might be found; who never complained, and was wonderful with
      the dogs. Close as their association was, Bickersteth had felt concerning
      the other that his real self was in some other sphere or place towards
      which his mind was always turning, as though to bring it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again had Bickersteth tried to get the old man to speak about
      the past, but he had been met by a dumb sort of look, a straining to
      understand. Once or twice the old man had taken his hands in both of his
      own, and gazed with painful eagerness into his face, as though trying to
      remember or to comprehend something that eluded him. Upon these occasions
      the old man&rsquo;s eyes dropped tears in an apathetic quiet, which tortured
      Bickersteth beyond bearing. Just such a look he had seen in the eyes of a
      favourite dog when he had performed an operation on it to save its life&mdash;a
      reproachful, non-comprehending, loving gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bickersteth understood a little of the Chinook language, which is familiar
      to most Indian tribes, and he had learned that the Indians knew nothing
      exact concerning the old man; but rumours had passed from tribe to tribe
      that this white man had lived for ever in the farthest north among the
      Arctic tribes, and that he passed from people to people, disappearing into
      the untenanted wilderness, but reappearing again among stranger tribes,
      never resting, and as one always seeking what he could not find.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing had helped this old man in all his travels and sojourning. He
      had, as it seemed to the native people, a gift of the hands; for when they
      were sick, a few moments&rsquo; manipulation of his huge, quiet fingers
      vanquished pain. A few herbs he gave in tincture, and these also were
      praised; but it was a legend that when he was persuaded to lay on his
      hands and close his eyes, and with his fingers to &ldquo;search for the pain and
      find it, and kill it,&rdquo; he always prevailed. They believed that though his
      body was on earth his soul was with Manitou, and that it was his soul
      which came into him again, and gave the Great Spirit&rsquo;s healing to the
      fingers. This had been the man&rsquo;s safety through how many years&mdash;or
      how many generations&mdash;they did not know; for legends regarding the
      pilgrim had grown and were fostered by the medicine men who, by giving him
      great age and supernatural power, could, with more self-respect, apologise
      for their own incapacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the years&mdash;how many it was impossible to tell, since he did not
      know or would not say&mdash;had gone on; and now, after ceaseless
      wandering, his face was turned towards that civilisation out of which he
      had come so long ago&mdash;or was it so long ago&mdash;one generation, or
      two, or ten? It seemed to Bickersteth at times as though it were ten, so
      strange, so unworldly was his companion. At first he thought that the man
      remembered more than he would appear to acknowledge, but he found that
      after a day or two everything that happened as they journeyed was also
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only visible things, or sounds, that appeared to open the doors of
      memory of the most recent happenings. These happenings, if not varied,
      were of critical moment, since, passing down from the land of unchanging
      ice and snow, they had come into March and April storms, and the perils of
      the rapids and the swollen floods of May. Now, in June, two years and a
      month since Bickersteth had gone into the wilds, they looked down upon the
      goal of one at least&mdash;of the younger man who had triumphed in his
      quest up in these wilds abandoned centuries ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the joyous thought in his heart, that he had discovered anew one of
      the greatest gold-fields of the world, that a journey unparalleled had
      been accomplished, he turned towards his ancient companion, and a feeling
      of pity and human love enlarged within him. He, John Bickersteth, was
      going into a world again, where&mdash;as he believed&mdash;a happy fate
      awaited him; but what of this old man? He had brought him out of the
      wilds, out of the unknown&mdash;was he only taking him into the unknown
      again? Were there friends, any friends anywhere in the world waiting for
      him? He called himself by no name, he said he had no name. Whence came he?
      Of whom? Whither was he wending now? Bickersteth had thought of the
      problem often, and he had no answer for it save that he must be taken care
      of, if not by others, then by himself; for the old man had saved him from
      drowning; had also saved him from an awful death on a March day when he
      fell into a great hole and was knocked insensible in the drifting snow;
      had saved him from brooding on himself&mdash;the beginning of madness&mdash;by
      compelling him to think for another. And sometimes, as he had looked at
      the old man, his imagination had caught the spirit of the legend of the
      Indians, and he had cried out, &ldquo;O soul, come back and give him memory&mdash;give
      him back his memory, Manitou the mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking on the old man now, an impulse seized him. &ldquo;Dear old man,&rdquo; he
      said, speaking as one speaks to a child that cannot understand, &ldquo;you shall
      never want, while I have a penny, or have head or hands to work. But is
      there no one that you care for or that cares for you, that you remember,
      or that remembers you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shook his head though not with understanding, and he laid a
      hand on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once it was always snow, but now it is green, the land. I have seen it&mdash;I
      have seen it once.&rdquo; His shaggy eyebrows gathered over, his eyes searched,
      searched the face of John Bickersteth. &ldquo;Once, so long ago&mdash;I cannot
      think,&rdquo; he added helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old man,&rdquo; Bickersteth said gently, knowing he would not wholly
      comprehend, &ldquo;I am going to ask her&mdash;Alice&mdash;to marry me, and if
      she does, she will help look after you, too. Neither of us would have been
      here without the other, dear old man, and we shall not be separated.
      Whoever you are, you are a gentleman, and you might have been my father or
      hers&mdash;or hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly. A thought had flashed through his mind, a thought
      which stunned him, which passed like some powerful current through his
      veins, shocked him, then gave him a palpitating life. It was a wild
      thought, but yet why not&mdash;why not? There was the chance, the faint,
      far-off chance. He caught the old man by the shoulders, and looked him in
      the eyes, scanned his features, pushed back the hair from the rugged
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old man,&rdquo; he said, his voice shaking, &ldquo;do you know what I&rsquo;m
      thinking? I&rsquo;m thinking that you may be of those who went out to the Arctic
      Sea with Sir John Franklin&mdash;with Sir John Franklin, you understand.
      Did you know Sir John Franklin&mdash;is it true, dear old boy, is it true?
      Are you one that has lived to tell the tale? Did you know Sir John
      Franklin&mdash;is it&mdash;tell me, is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let go the old man&rsquo;s shoulders, for over the face of the other there
      had passed a change. It was strained and tense. The hands were
      outstretched, the eyes were staring straight into the west and the coming
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Bickersteth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;love
      o&rsquo; God, that&rsquo;s it! Sir John Franklin&mdash;Sir John Franklin, and all the
      brave lads that died up there! You remember the ship&mdash;the Arctic Sea&mdash;the
      ice-fields, and Franklin&mdash;you remember him? Dear old man, say you
      remember Franklin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing had seized him. Conviction was upon him, and he watched the
      other&rsquo;s anguished face with anguish and excitement in his own. But&mdash;but
      it might be, it might be her father&mdash;the eyes, the forehead are like
      hers; the hands, the long hands, the pointed fingers. &ldquo;Come, tell me, did
      you have a wife and child, and were they both called Alice&mdash;do you
      remember? Franklin&mdash;Alice! Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other got slowly to his feet, his arms outstretched, the look in his
      face changing, understanding struggling for its place, memory fighting for
      its own, the soul contending for its mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Franklin&mdash;Alice&mdash;the snow,&rdquo; he said confusedly, and sank down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God have mercy!&rdquo; cried Bickersteth, as he caught the swaying body, and
      laid it upon the ground. &ldquo;He was there&mdash;almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He settled the old man against the great pine stump and chafed his hands.
      &ldquo;Man, dear man, if you belong to her&mdash;if you do, can&rsquo;t you see what
      it will mean to me? She can&rsquo;t say no to me then. But if it&rsquo;s true, you&rsquo;ll
      belong to England and to all the world, too, and you&rsquo;ll have fame
      everlasting. I&rsquo;ll have gold for her and for you, and for your Alice, too,
      poor old boy. Wake up now and remember if you are Luke Allingham who went
      with Franklin to the silent seas of the Pole. If it&rsquo;s you, really you,
      what wonder you lost your memory! You saw them all die, Franklin and all,
      die there in the snow, with all the white world round them. If you were
      there, what a travel you have had, what strange things you have seen!
      Where the world is loneliest, God lives most. If you get close to the
      heart of things, it&rsquo;s no marvel you forgot what you were, or where you
      came from; because it didn&rsquo;t matter; you knew that you were only one of
      thousands of millions who have come and gone, that make up the soul of
      things, that make the pulses of the universe beat. That&rsquo;s it, dear old
      man. The universe would die, if it weren&rsquo;t for the souls that leave this
      world and fill it with life. Wake up! Wake up, Allingham, and tell us
      where you&rsquo;ve been and what you&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not labour in vain. Slowly consciousness came back, and the grey
      eyes opened wide, the lips smiled faintly under the bushy beard; but
      Bickersteth saw that the look in the face was much the same as it had been
      before. The struggle had been too great, the fight for the other lost self
      had exhausted him, mind and body, and only a deep obliquity and a great
      weariness filled the countenance. He had come back to the verge, he had
      almost again discovered himself; but the opening door had shut fast
      suddenly, and he was back again in the night, the incompanionable night of
      forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bickersteth saw that the travail and strife had drained life and energy,
      and that he must not press the mind and vitality of this exile of time and
      the unknown too far. He felt that when the next test came the old man
      would either break completely, and sink down into another and everlasting
      forgetfulness, or tear away forever the veil between himself and his past,
      and emerge into a long-lost life. His strength must be shepherded, and he
      must be kept quiet and undisturbed until they came to the town yonder in
      the valley, over which the night was slowly settling down. There two women
      waited, the two Alices, from both of whom had gone lovers into the North.
      The daughter was living over again in her young love the pangs of suspense
      through which her mother had passed. Two years since Bickersteth had gone,
      and not a sign!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, if the girl had looked from her bedroom window, this Friday night,
      she would have seen on the far hill a sign; for there burned a fire beside
      which sat two travellers who had come from the uttermost limits of snow.
      But as the fire burned&mdash;a beacon to her heart if she had but known it&mdash;she
      went to her bed, the words of a song she had sung at choir&mdash;practice
      with tears in her voice and in her heart ringing in her ears. A concert
      was to be held after the service on the coming Sunday night, at which
      there was to be a collection for funds to build another mission-house a
      hundred miles farther North, and she had been practising music she was to
      sing. Her mother had been an amateur singer of great power, and she was
      renewing her mother&rsquo;s gift in a voice behind which lay a hidden sorrow. As
      she cried herself to sleep the words of the song which had moved her kept
      ringing in her ears and echoing in her heart:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;When the swallows homeward fly,
        And the roses&rsquo; bloom is o&rsquo;er&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But her mother, looking out into the night, saw on the far hill the fire,
      burning like a star, where she had never seen a fire set before, and a
      hope shot into her heart for her daughter&mdash;a hope that had flamed up
      and died down so often during the past year. Yet she had fanned with
      heartening words every such glimmer of hope when it came, and now she went
      to bed saying, &ldquo;Perhaps he will come to-morrow.&rdquo; In her mind, too, rang
      the words of the song which had ravished her ears that night, the song she
      had sung the night before her own husband, Luke Allingham, had gone with
      Franklin to the Polar seas:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the swallows homeward fly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she and her daughter entered the little church on the Sunday evening,
      two men came over the prairie slowly towards the town, and both raised
      their heads to the sound of the church-bell calling to prayer. In the eyes
      of the younger man there was a look which has come to many in this world
      returning from hard enterprise and great dangers, to the familiar streets,
      the friendly faces of men of their kin and clan-to the lights of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the older man, however, had another look.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a look as is seldom seen in the faces of men, for it showed
      the struggle of a soul to regain its identity. The words which the old man
      had uttered in response to Bickersteth&rsquo;s appeal before he fainted away,
      &ldquo;Franklin&mdash;Alice&mdash;the snow,&rdquo; had showed that he was on the
      verge; the bells of the church pealing in the summer air brought him near
      it once again. How many years had gone since he had heard church-bells?
      Bickersteth, gazing at him in eager scrutiny, wondered if, after all, he
      might be mistaken about him. But no, this man had never been born and bred
      in the far North. His was a type which belonged to the civilisation from
      which he himself had come. There would soon be the test of it all. Yet he
      shuddered, too, to think what might happen if it was all true, and
      discovery or reunion should shake to the centre the very life of the two
      long-parted ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the look of perplexed pain and joy at once in the face of the old
      man, but he said nothing, and he was almost glad when the bell stopped.
      The old man turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I remember&mdash;&rdquo; but he stopped suddenly,
      shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, cleared of the dust of travel, the two walked slowly
      towards the church from the little tavern where they were lodged. The
      service was now over, but the concert had begun. The church was full, and
      there were people in the porch; but these made way for the two strangers;
      and, as Bickersteth was recognised by two or three present, place was
      found for them. Inside, the old man stared round him in a confused and
      troubled way, but his motions were quiet and abstracted and he looked like
      some old viking, his workaday life done, come to pray ere he went hence
      forever. They had entered in a pause in the concert, but now two ladies
      came forward to the chancel steps, and one with her hands clasped before
      her, began to sing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;When the swallows homeward fly,
        And the roses&rsquo; bloom is o&rsquo;er,
        And the nightingale&rsquo;s sweet song
        In the woods is heard no more&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was Alice&mdash;Alice the daughter&mdash;and presently the mother, the
      other Alice, joined in the refrain. At sight of them Bickersteth&rsquo;s eyes
      had filled, not with tears, but with a cloud of feeling, so that he went
      blind. There she was, the girl he loved. Her voice was ringing in his
      ears. In his own joy for one instant he had forgotten the old man beside
      him, and the great test that was now upon him. He turned quickly, however,
      as the old man got to his feet. For an instant the lost exile of the North
      stood as though transfixed. The blood slowly drained from his face, and in
      his eyes was an agony of struggle and desire. For a moment an awful
      confusion had the mastery, and then suddenly a clear light broke into his
      eyes, his face flushed healthily and shone, his arms went up, and there
      rang in his ears the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Then I think with bitter pain,
        Shall we ever meet again?
        When the swallows homeward fly&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice&mdash;Alice!&rdquo; he called, and tottered forward up the aisle,
      followed by John Bickersteth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice, I have come back!&rdquo; he cried again.

    <h2>
      GEORGE&rsquo;S WIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s come, and she can go back. No one asked her, no one wants her, and
      she&rsquo;s got no rights here. She thinks she&rsquo;ll come it over me, but she&rsquo;ll
      get nothing, and there&rsquo;s no place for her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old, grey-bearded man, gnarled and angular, with overhanging brows and
      a harsh face, made this little speech of malice and unfriendliness,
      looking out on the snow-covered prairie through the window. Far in the
      distance were a sleigh and horses like a spot in the snow, growing larger
      from minute to minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a day of days. Overhead, the sun was pouring out a flood of light
      and warmth, and though it was bitterly cold, life was beating hard in the
      bosom of the West. Men walked lightly, breathed quickly, and their eyes
      were bright with the brightness of vitality and content. Even the old man
      at the window of this lonely house, in a great lonely stretch of country,
      with the cedar hills behind it, had a living force which defied his
      seventy odd years, though the light in his face was hard and his voice was
      harder still. Under the shelter of the foothills, cold as the day was, his
      cattle were feeding in the open, scratching away the thin layer of snow,
      and browsing on the tender grass underneath. An arctic world in
      appearance, it had an abounding life which made it friendly and generous&mdash;the
      harshness belonged to the surface. So, perhaps, it was with the old man
      who watched the sleigh in the distance coming nearer, but that in his
      nature on which any one could feed was not so easily reached as the fresh
      young grass under the protecting snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get nothing out of me,&rdquo; he repeated, as the others in the room
      behind him made no remark, and his eyes ranged gloatingly over the cattle
      under the foothills and the buildings which he had gathered together to
      proclaim his substantial greatness in the West. &ldquo;Not a sous markee,&rdquo; he
      added, clinking some coins in his pocket. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got no rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassy&rsquo;s got as much right here as any of us, Abel, and she&rsquo;s coming to
      say it, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice which spoke was unlike a Western voice. It was deep and full and
      slow, with an organ-like quality. It was in good keeping with the tall,
      spare body and large, fine rugged face of the woman to whom it belonged.
      She sat in a rocking-chair, but did not rock, her fingers busy with the
      knitting-needles, her feet planted squarely on the home-made hassock at
      her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man waited for a minute in a painful silence, then he turned
      slowly round, and, with tight-pressed lips, looked at the woman in the
      rocking-chair. If it had been anyone else who had &ldquo;talked back&rdquo; at him, he
      would have made quick work of them, for he was of that class of tyrant who
      pride themselves on being self-made, and have an undue respect for their
      own judgment and importance. But the woman who had ventured to challenge
      his cold-blooded remarks about his dead son&rsquo;s wife, now hastening over the
      snow to the house her husband had left under a cloud eight years before,
      had no fear of him, and, maybe, no deep regard for him. He respected her,
      as did all who knew her&mdash;a very reticent, thoughtful, busy being, who
      had been like a well of comfort to so many that had drunk and passed on
      out of her life, out of time and time&rsquo;s experiences. Seventy-nine years
      saw her still upstanding, strong, full of work, and fuller of life&rsquo;s
      knowledge. It was she who had sent the horses and sleigh for &ldquo;Gassy,&rdquo; when
      the old man, having read the letter that Cassy had written him, said that
      she could &ldquo;freeze at the station&rdquo; for all of him. Aunt Kate had said
      nothing then, but, when the time came, by her orders the sleigh and horses
      were at the station; and the old man had made no direct protest, for she
      was the one person he had never dominated nor bullied. If she had only
      talked, he would have worn her down, for he was fond of talking, and it
      was said by those who were cynical and incredulous about him that he had
      gone to prayer-meetings, had been a local preacher, only to hear his own
      voice. Probably if there had been any politics in the West in his day, he
      would have been a politician, though it would have been too costly for his
      taste, and religion was very cheap; it enabled him to refuse to join in
      many forms of expenditure, on the ground that he &ldquo;did not hold by such
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Aunt Kate, the sister of his wife, dead so many years ago, he had found
      a spirit stronger than his own. He valued her; he had said more than once,
      to those who he thought would never repeat it to her, that she was a
      &ldquo;great woman&rdquo;; but self-interest was the mainspring of his appreciation.
      Since she had come again to his house&mdash;she had lived with him once
      before for two years when his wife was slowly dying&mdash;it had been a
      different place. Housekeeping had cost less than before, yet the cooking
      was better, the place was beautifully clean, and discipline without
      rigidity reigned everywhere. One by one the old woman&rsquo;s boys and girls had
      died&mdash;four of them&mdash;and she was now alone, with not a single
      grandchild left to cheer her; and the life out here with Abel Baragar had
      been unrelieved by much that was heartening to a woman; for Black Andy,
      Abel&rsquo;s son, was not an inspiring figure, though even his moroseness gave
      way under her influence. So it was that when Cassy&rsquo;s letter came, her
      breast seemed to grow warmer, and swell with longing to see the wife of
      her nephew, who had such a bad reputation in Abel&rsquo;s eyes, and to see
      George&rsquo;s little boy, who was coming too. After all, whatever Cassy was,
      she was the mother of Abel&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son; and Aunt Kate was too old and wise
      to be frightened by tales told of Cassy or any one else. So, having had
      her own way so far regarding Cassy&rsquo;s coming, she looked Abel calmly in the
      eyes, over the gold-rimmed spectacles which were her dearest possession&mdash;almost
      the only thing of value she had. She was not afraid of Abel&rsquo;s anger, and
      he knew it; but his eldest son, Black Andy, was present, and he must make
      a show of being master of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Kate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make a fuss about you sending the horses
      and sleigh for her, because women do fool things sometimes. I suppose
      curiosity got the best of you. Anyhow, mebbe it&rsquo;s right Cassy should find
      out, once for all, how things stand, and that they haven&rsquo;t altered since
      she took George away, and ruined his life, and sent him to his grave.
      That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t order Mick back when I saw him going out with the
      team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassy Mavor,&rdquo; interjected a third voice from a corner behind the great
      stove&mdash;&ldquo;Cassy Mavor, of the variety-dance-and-song, and a talk with
      the gallery between!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate looked over at Black Andy, and stopped knitting, for there was
      that in the tone of the sullen ranchman which stirred in her a sudden
      anger, and anger was a rare and uncomfortable sensation to her. A flush
      crept slowly over her face, then it died away, and she said quietly to
      Black Andy&mdash;for she had ever prayed to be master of the demon of
      temper down deep in her, and she was praying now:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She earnt her living by singing and dancing, and she&rsquo;s brought up
      George&rsquo;s boy by it, and singing and dancing isn&rsquo;t a crime. David danced
      before the Lord. I danced myself when I was a young girl, and before I
      joined the church. &lsquo;Twas about the only pleasure I ever had; &lsquo;bout the
      only one I like to remember. There&rsquo;s no difference to me &lsquo;twixt making
      your feet handy and clever and full of music, and playing with your
      fingers on the piano or on a melodeon at a meeting. As for singing, it&rsquo;s
      God&rsquo;s gift; and many a time I wisht I had it. I&rsquo;d have sung the blackness
      out of your face and heart, Andy.&rdquo; She leaned back again and began to knit
      very fast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear Cassy sing, and see her dance too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Andy chuckled coarsely, &ldquo;I often heard her sing and saw her dance
      down at Lumley&rsquo;s before she took George away East. You wouldn&rsquo;t have
      guessed she had consumption. She knocked the boys over down to Lumley&rsquo;s.
      The first night at Lumley&rsquo;s done for George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Andy&rsquo;s face showed no lightening of its gloom as he spoke, but there
      was a firing up of the black eyes, and the woman with the knitting felt
      that&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;he was purposely irritating his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil was in her heels and in her tongue,&rdquo; Andy continued. &ldquo;With her
      big mouth, red hair, and little eyes, she&rsquo;d have made anybody laugh. I
      laughed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laughed!&rdquo; snapped out his father with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Andy&rsquo;s eyes half closed with a morose look, then he went on. &ldquo;Yes, I
      laughed at Cassy. While she was out here at Lumley&rsquo;s getting cured,
      accordin&rsquo; to the doctor&rsquo;s orders, things seemed to get a move on in the
      West. But it didn&rsquo;t suit professing Christians like you, dad.&rdquo; He jerked
      his head towards the old man and drew the spittoon near with his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The West hasn&rsquo;t been any worse off since she left,&rdquo; snarled the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she took George with her,&rdquo; grimly retorted Black Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Baragar&rsquo;s heart had been warmer towards his dead son George than to
      any one else in the world. George had been as fair of face and hair as
      Andrew was dark; as cheerful and amusing as Andrew was gloomy and
      dispiriting; as agile and dexterous of mind and body as his brother was
      slow and angular; as emotional and warm-hearted as the other was
      phlegmatic and sour&mdash;or so it seemed to the father and to nearly all
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those old days they had not been very well off. The railway was not
      completed, and the West had not begun &ldquo;to move.&rdquo; The old man had bought
      and sold land and cattle and horses, always living on a narrow margin of
      safety, but in the hope that one day the choice bits of land he was
      shepherding here and there would take a leap up in value; and his judgment
      had been right. His prosperity had all come since George went away with
      Cassy Mavor. His anger at George had been the more acute, because the
      thing happened at a time when his affairs were on the edge of a precipice.
      He had won through it, but only by the merest shave, and it had all left
      him with a bad spot in his heart, in spite of his &ldquo;having religion.&rdquo;
       Whenever he remembered George, he instinctively thought of those black
      days when a Land and Cattle Syndicate was crowding him over the edge into
      the chasm of failure, and came so near doing it. A few thousand dollars
      less to put up here and there, and he would have been ruined; his blood
      became hotter whenever he thought of it. He had had to fight the worst of
      it through alone, for George, who had been useful as a kind of buyer and
      seller, who was ever all things to all men, and ready with quip and jest,
      and not a little uncertain as to truth&mdash;to which the old man shut his
      eyes when there was a &ldquo;deal&rdquo; on&mdash;had, in the end, been of no use at
      all, and had seemed to go to pieces just when he was most needed. His
      father had put it all down to Cassy Mavor, who had unsettled things since
      she had come to Lumley&rsquo;s, and being a man of very few ideas, he cherished
      those he had with an exaggerated care. Prosperity had not softened him; it
      had given him an arrogance unduly emphasised by a reputation for rigid
      virtue and honesty. The indirect attack which Andrew now made on George&rsquo;s
      memory roused him to anger, as much because it seemed to challenge his own
      judgment as cast a slight on the name of the boy whom he had cast off, yet
      who had a firmer hold on his heart than any human being ever had. It had
      only been pride which had prevented him from making it up with George
      before it was too late; but, all the more, he was set against the woman
      who &ldquo;kicked up her heels for a living&rdquo;; and, all the more, he resented
      Black Andy, who, in his own grim way, had managed to remain a partner with
      him in their present prosperity, and had done so little for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George helped to make what you&rsquo;ve got, Andy,&rdquo; he said darkly now. &ldquo;The
      West missed George. The West said, &lsquo;There was a good man ruined by a
      woman.&rsquo; The West&rsquo;d never think anything or anybody missed you, &lsquo;cept
      yourself. When you went North, it never missed you; when you come back,
      its jaw fell. You wasn&rsquo;t fit to black George&rsquo;s boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Andy&rsquo;s mouth took on a bitter sort of smile, and his eyes drooped
      furtively, as he struck the damper of the stove heavily with his foot,
      then he replied slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right; but if I wasn&rsquo;t fit to black his boots, it ain&rsquo;t
      my fault. I git my nature honest, as he did. We wasn&rsquo;t any cross-breeds, I
      s&rsquo;pose. We got the strain direct, and we was all right on her side.&rdquo; He
      jerked his head towards Aunt Kate, whose face was growing pale. She
      interposed now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you leave the dead alone?&rdquo; she asked in a voice ringing a little.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you let them rest? Ain&rsquo;t it enough to quarrel about the living?
      Cassy&rsquo;ll be here soon,&rdquo; she added, peering out of the window, &ldquo;and if I
      was you, I&rsquo;d try and not make her sorry she ever married a Baragar. It
      ain&rsquo;t a feeling that&rsquo;d make a sick woman live long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate did not strike often, but when she did, she struck hard. Abel
      Baragar staggered a little under this blow, for, at the moment, it seemed
      to him that he saw his dead wife&rsquo;s face looking at him from the chair
      where her sister now sat. Down in his ill-furnished heart, where there had
      been little which was companionable, there was a shadowed corner. Sophy
      Baragar had been such a true-hearted, brave-souled woman, and he had been
      so impatient and exacting with her, till the beautiful face, which had
      been reproduced in George, had lost its colour and its fire, had become
      careworn and sweet with that sweetness which goes early out of the world.
      In all her days the vanished wife had never hinted at as much as Aunt Kate
      suggested now, and Abel Baragar shut his eyes against the thing which he
      was seeing. He was not all hard, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate turned to Black Andy now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe Cassy ain&rsquo;t for long,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mebbe she&rsquo;s come out for what she
      came out for before. It seems to me it&rsquo;s that, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have come;
      because she&rsquo;s young yet, and she&rsquo;s fond of her boy, and she&rsquo;d not want to
      bury herself alive out here with us. Mebbe her lungs is bad again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s sure to get another husband out here,&rdquo; said the old man,
      recovering himself. &ldquo;She got one before easy, on the same ticket.&rdquo; With
      something of malice he looked over at Black Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she can sing and dance as she done nine years ago, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder,&rdquo; answered Black Andy smoothly. These two men knew each other; they
      had said hard things to each other for many a year, yet they lived on
      together unshaken by each other&rsquo;s moods and bitternesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old,&mdash;I&rsquo;m seventy-nine,&mdash;and I ain&rsquo;t for long,&rdquo;
       urged Aunt Kate, looking Abel in the eyes. &ldquo;Some day soon I&rsquo;ll be stepping
      out and away. Then things&rsquo;ll go to sixes and sevens, as they did after
      Sophy died. Some one ought to be here that&rsquo;s got a right to be here, not a
      hired woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the old man raged out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her&mdash;off the stage, to look after this! Her, that&rsquo;s kicked up her
      heels for a living! It&rsquo;s&mdash;no, she&rsquo;s no good. She&rsquo;s common. She&rsquo;s
      come, and she can go. I ain&rsquo;t having sweepings from the streets living
      here as if they had rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate set her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweepings! You&rsquo;ve got to take that back, Abel. It&rsquo;s not Christian. You&rsquo;ve
      got to take that back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take it back all right before we&rsquo;ve done, I guess,&rdquo; remarked Black
      Andy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take a lot back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth&rsquo;s truth, and I&rsquo;ll stand by it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stopped, for there came to them now, clearly, the sound of
      sleigh bells. They all stood still for an instant, silent and attentive,
      then Aunt Kate moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassy&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Cassy and George&rsquo;s boy&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another instant and the door was opened on the beautiful, white, sparkling
      world, and the low sleigh, with its great warm buffalo robes, in which the
      small figures of a woman and a child were almost lost, stopped at the
      door. Two whimsical but tired eyes looked over a rim of fur at the old
      woman in the doorway, then Cassy&rsquo;s voice rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, that&rsquo;s Aunt Kate, I know! Well, here we are, and here&rsquo;s my boy.
      Jump, George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, and the gaunt old woman folded both mother and son in her
      arms and drew them into the room. The door was shut, and they all faced
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man and Black Andy did not move, but stood staring at the trim
      figure in black, with the plain face, large mouth, and tousled red hair,
      and the dreamy-eyed, handsome little boy beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Andy stood behind the stove, looking over at the new-comers with
      quizzical, almost furtive eyes, and his father remained for a moment with
      mouth open, gazing at his dead son&rsquo;s wife and child, as though not quite
      comprehending the scene. The sight of the boy had brought back, in some
      strange, embarrassing way, a vision of thirty years before, when George
      was a little boy in buckskin pants and jacket, and was beginning to ride
      the prairie with him. This boy was like George, yet not like him. The face
      was George&rsquo;s, the sensuous, luxurious mouth; but the eyes were not those
      of a Baragar, nor yet those of Aunt Kate&rsquo;s family; and they were not
      wholly like the mother&rsquo;s. They were full and brimming, while hers were
      small and whimsical; yet they had her quick, humourous flashes and her
      quaintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I changed so much? Have you forgotten me?&rdquo; Cassy asked, looking the
      old man in the eyes. &ldquo;You look as strong as a bull.&rdquo; She held out her hand
      to him and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I see you well,&rdquo; said Abel Baragar mechanically, as he took the hand
      and shook it awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; answered the nonchalant little woman, undoing her
      jacket. &ldquo;Shake hands with your grandfather, George. That&rsquo;s right&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      talk too much,&rdquo; she added, with a half-nervous little laugh, as the old
      man, with a kind of fixed smile, and the child shook hands in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she saw Black Andy behind the stove. &ldquo;Well, Andy, have you been
      here ever since?&rdquo; she asked, and, as he came forward, she suddenly caught
      him by both arms, stood on tiptoe, and kissed him. &ldquo;Last time I saw you,
      you were behind the stove at Lumley&rsquo;s. Nothing&rsquo;s ever too warm for you,&rdquo;
       she added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be shivering on the Equator. You were always hugging the
      stove at Lumley&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things was pretty warm there, too, Cassy,&rdquo; he said, with a sidelong look
      at his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the look, her face flashed with sudden temper, then her eyes fell
      on her boy, now lost in the arms of Aunt Kate, and she curbed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were plenty of things doing at Lumley&rsquo;s in those days,&rdquo; she said
      brusquely. &ldquo;We were all young and fresh then,&rdquo; she added, and then
      something seemed to catch her voice, and she coughed a little&mdash;a
      hard, dry, feverish cough. &ldquo;Are the Lumleys all right? Are they still
      there, at the Forks?&rdquo; she asked, after the little paroxysm of coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cleaned out&mdash;all scattered. We own the Lumleys&rsquo; place now,&rdquo; replied
      Black Andy, with another sidelong glance at his father, who, as he put
      some more wood on the fire and opened the damper of the stove wider,
      grimly watched and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, and Lance, and Jerry, and Abner?&rdquo; she asked almost abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s dead-shot by a U. S. marshal by mistake for a smuggler,&rdquo; answered
      Black Andy suggestively. &ldquo;Lance is up on the Yukon, busted; Jerry is one
      of our hands on the place; and Abner is in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abner-in jail!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a dazed way. &ldquo;What did he do? Abner
      always seemed so straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he sloped with a thousand dollars of the railway people&rsquo;s money. They
      caught him, and he got seven years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was married, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice. &ldquo;Yes, to Phenie
      Tyson. There&rsquo;s no children, so she&rsquo;s all right, and divorce is cheap over
      in the States, where she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phenie Tyson didn&rsquo;t marry Abner because he was a saint, but because he
      was a man, I suppose,&rdquo; she replied gravely. &ldquo;And the old folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both dead. What Abner done sent the old man to his grave. But Abner&rsquo;s
      mother died a year before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Abner done killed his father,&rdquo; said Abel Baragar with dry emphasis.
      &ldquo;Phenie Tyson was extravagant-wanted this and that, and nothin&rsquo; was too
      good for her. Abner spoilt his life gettin&rsquo; her what she wanted; and it
      broke old Ezra Lumley&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George&rsquo;s wife looked at him for a moment with her eyes screwed up, and
      then she laughed softly. &ldquo;My, it&rsquo;s curious how some folks go up and some
      go down! It must be lonely for Phenie waiting all these years for Abner to
      get free.... I had the happiest time in my life at Lumley&rsquo;s. I was getting
      better of my-cold. While I was there I got lots of strength stored up, to
      last me many a year when I needed it; and, then, George and I were married
      at Lumley&rsquo;s....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate came slowly over with the boy, and laid a hand on Cassy&rsquo;s
      shoulder, for there was an undercurrent to the conversation which boded no
      good. The very first words uttered had plunged Abel Baragar and his son&rsquo;s
      wife into the midst of the difficulty which she had hoped might, after
      all, be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, and I&rsquo;ll show you your room, Cassy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It faces south, and
      you&rsquo;ll get the sun all day. It&rsquo;s like a sun-parlour. We&rsquo;re going to have
      supper in a couple of hours, and you must rest some first. Is the house
      warm enough for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little, garish woman did not reply directly, but shook back her red
      hair and caught her boy to her breast and kissed him; then she said in
      that staccato manner which had given her words on the stage such point and
      emphasis, &ldquo;Oh, this house is a&rsquo;most too warm for me, Aunt Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she moved towards the door with the grave, kindly old woman, her
      son&rsquo;s hand in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see the Lumleys&rsquo; place from your window, Cassy,&rdquo; said Black Andy
      grimly. &ldquo;We got a mortgage on it, and foreclosed it, and it&rsquo;s ours now;
      and Jerry Lumley&rsquo;s stock-riding for us. Anyhow, he&rsquo;s better off than
      Abner, or Abner&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cassy turned at the door and faced him. Instinctively she caught at some
      latent conflict with old Abel Baragar in what Black Andy had said, and her
      face softened, for it suddenly flashed into her mind that he was not
      against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be back West,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It meant a lot to me when I was at
      Lumley&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She coughed a little again, but turned to the door with a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you come to stay here&mdash;out West?&rdquo; asked the old man
      furtively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s plenty of time to think of that!&rdquo; she answered brusquely,
      and she heard Black Andy laugh derisively as the door closed behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a blaze of joy the sun swept down behind the southern hills, and the
      windows of Lumley&rsquo;s house at the Forks, catching the oblique rays,
      glittered and shone like flaming silver. Nothing of life showed, save the
      cattle here and there, creeping away to the shelter of the foothills for
      the night. The white, placid snow made a coverlet as wide as the vision of
      the eye, save where spruce and cedar trees gave a touch of warmth and
      refuge here and there. A wonderful, buoyant peace seemed to rest upon the
      wide, silent expanse. The birds of song were gone South over the hills,
      and the living wild things of the prairies had stolen into winter
      quarters. Yet, as Cassy Mavor looked out upon the exquisite beauty of the
      scene, upon the splendid outspanning of the sun along the hills, the deep
      plangent blue of the sky and the thrilling light, she saw a world in agony
      and she heard the moans of the afflicted. The sun shone bright on the
      windows of Lumley&rsquo;s house, but she could hear the crying of Abner&rsquo;s wife,
      and of old Ezra and Eliza Lumley, when their children were stricken or
      shamed; when Abel Baragar drew tighter and tighter the chains of the
      mortgage, which at last made them tenants in the house once their own.
      Only eight years ago, and all this had happened. And what had not happened
      to her, too, in those eight years!
    </p>
    <p>
      With George&mdash;reckless, useless, loving, lying George&mdash;she had
      left Lumley&rsquo;s with her sickness cured, as it seemed, after a long year in
      the West, and had begun life again. What sort of life had it been?
      &ldquo;Kicking up her heels on the stage,&rdquo; as Abel Baragar had said; but,
      somehow, not as it was before she went West to give her perforated lung to
      the healing air of the plains, and to live outdoors with the men&mdash;a
      man&rsquo;s life. Then she had never put a curb on her tongue, or greatly on her
      actions, except that, though a hundred men quarrelled openly, or in their
      own minds, about her, no one had ever had any right to quarrel about her.
      With a tongue which made men gasp with laughter, with as comic a gift as
      ever woman had, and as equally comic a face, she had been a good-natured
      little tyrant in her way. She had given a kiss here and there, and had
      taken one, but always there had been before her mind the picture of a
      careworn woman who struggled to bring up her three children honestly, and
      without the help of charity, and, with a sigh of content and weariness,
      had died as Cassy made her first hit on the stage and her name became a
      household word. And Cassy, garish, gay, freckled, witty and whimsical, had
      never forgotten those days when her mother prayed and worked her heart out
      to do her duty by her children. Cassy Mavor had made her following, had
      won her place, was the idol of &ldquo;the gallery&rdquo;; and yet she was &ldquo;of the
      people,&rdquo; as she had always been, until her first sickness came, and she
      had gone out to Lumley&rsquo;s, out along the foothills of the Rockies.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had made her fall in love with George Baragar?
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not have told, if she had been asked. He was wayward, given to
      drink at times, given also to card-playing and racing; but he had a way
      with him which few women could resist and which made men his friends; and
      he had a sense of humour akin to her own. In any case, one day she let him
      catch her up in his arms, and there was the end of it. But no, not the
      end, after all. It was only the beginning of real life for her. All that
      had gone before seemed but playing on the threshold, though it had meant
      hard, bitter hard work, and temptation, and patience, and endurance of
      many kinds. And now George was gone for ever. But George&rsquo;s little boy lay
      there on the bed in a soft sleep, with all his life before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the warm window and the buoyant, inspiring scene to the
      bed. Stooping over, she kissed the sleeping boy with an abrupt eagerness,
      and made a little awkward, hungry gesture of love over him, and her face
      flushed hot with the passion of motherhood in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got now,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Nothing else left&mdash;nothing else at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard the door open behind her, and she turned round. Aunt Kate was
      entering with a bowl in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you moving about, and I&rsquo;ve brought you something hot to drink,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s real good of you, Aunt Kate,&rdquo; was the cheerful reply. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      near supper-time, and I don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s boneset tea&mdash;for your cold,&rdquo; answered Aunt Kate gently, and put
      it on the high dressing-table made of a wooden box and covered with
      muslin. &ldquo;For your cold, Cassy,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little woman stood still a moment gazing at the steaming bowl, lines
      growing suddenly around her mouth, then she looked at Aunt Kate
      quizzically. &ldquo;Is my cold bad&mdash;so bad that I need boneset?&rdquo; she asked
      in a queer, constrained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s comforting, is boneset tea, even when there&rsquo;s no cold, &lsquo;specially
      when the whiskey&rsquo;s good, and the boneset and camomile has steeped some
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been steeping them some days?&rdquo; Cassy asked softly, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate nodded, then tried to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always good to be prepared, and I didn&rsquo;t know but what the cold you
      used to have might be come back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad if it ain&rsquo;t, if
      that cough of yours is only one of the measly little hacks people get in
      the East, where it&rsquo;s so damp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cassy was at the window again, looking out at the dying radiance of the
      sun. Her voice seemed hollow and strange and rather rough, as she said in
      reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real cold, deep down, the same as I had nine years ago, Aunt Kate;
      and it&rsquo;s come to stay, I guess. That&rsquo;s why I came back West. But I
      couldn&rsquo;t have gone to Lumley&rsquo;s again, even if they were at the Forks now,
      for I&rsquo;m too poor. I&rsquo;m a back-number now. I had to give up singing and
      dancing a year ago, after George died. So I don&rsquo;t earn my living any more,
      and I had to come to George&rsquo;s father with George&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Kate had a shrewd mind, and it was tactful, too. She did not
      understand why Cassy, who had earned so much money all these years, should
      be so poor now, unless it was that she hadn&rsquo;t saved&mdash;that she and
      George hadn&rsquo;t saved. But, looking at the face before her, and the child on
      the bed, she was convinced that the woman was a good woman, that, singer
      and dancer as she was, there was no reason why any home should be closed
      to her, or any heart should shut its doors before her. She guessed a
      reason for this poverty of Cassy Mavor, but it only made her lay a hand on
      the little woman&rsquo;s shoulders and look into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassy,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;you was right to come here. There&rsquo;s trials
      before you, but for the boy&rsquo;s sake you must bear them. Sophy, George&rsquo;s
      mother, had to bear them, and Abel was fond of her, too, in his way. He&rsquo;s
      stored up a lot of things to say, and he&rsquo;ll say them; but you&rsquo;ll keep the
      boy in your mind, and be patient, won&rsquo;t you, Cassy? You got rights here,
      and it&rsquo;s comfortable, and there&rsquo;s plenty, and the air will cure your lung
      as it did before. It did all right before, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She handed the bowl
      of boneset tea. &ldquo;Take it; it&rsquo;ll do you good, Cassy,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassy said nothing in reply. She looked at the bed where her boy lay, she
      looked at the angular face of the woman, with its brooding motherliness,
      at the soft, grey hair, and, with a little gasp of feeling, she raised the
      bowl to her lips and drank freely. Then, putting it down, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mean to have us, Aunt Kate, but I&rsquo;ll try and keep my temper
      down. Did he ever laugh in his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He laughs sometimes&mdash;kind o&rsquo; laughs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him laugh real, if I can,&rdquo; Cassy rejoined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a lot of
      people laugh in my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman leaned suddenly over, and drew the red, ridiculous head to
      her shoulder with a gasp of affection, and her eyes were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;Cassy, you make me cry.&rdquo; Then she turned and
      hurried from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later the problem was solved in the big sitting-room where
      Cassy had first been received with her boy. Aunt Kate sat with her feet on
      a hassock, rocking gently and watching and listening. Black Andy was
      behind the great stove with his chair tilted back, carving the bowl of a
      pipe; the old man sat rigid by the table, looking straight before him and
      smacking his lips now and then as he was won&rsquo;t to do at meeting; while
      Cassy, with her chin in her hands and elbows on her knees, gazed into the
      fire and waited for the storm to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her little flashes of humour at dinner had not brightened things, and she
      had had an insane desire to turn cart-wheels round the room, so implacable
      and highly strained was the attitude of the master of the house, so
      unctuous was the grace and the thanksgiving before and after the meal.
      Abel Baragar had stored up his anger and his righteous antipathy for
      years, and this was the first chance he had had of visiting his
      displeasure on the woman who had &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; George, and who had now come to
      get &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; which he was determined she should not have. He had steeled
      himself against seeing any good in her whatever. Self-will, self-pride,
      and self-righteousness were big in him, and so the supper had ended in
      silence, and with a little attack of coughing on the part of Cassy, which
      made her angry at herself. Then the boy had been put to bed, and she had
      come back to await the expected outburst. She could feel it in the air,
      and while her blood tingled in a desire to fight this tyrant to the bitter
      end, she thought of her boy and his future, and she calmed the tumult in
      her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not have to wait very long. The querulous voice of the old man
      broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When be you goin&rsquo; back East? What time did you fix for goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked at him squarely. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fix any time for
      going East again,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I came out West this time to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you was on the stage,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left the stage. My voice went when I got a bad cold again, and I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand the draughts of the theatre, and so I couldn&rsquo;t dance,
      either. I&rsquo;m finished with the stage. I&rsquo;ve come out here for good and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you think of livin&rsquo; out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have gone to Lumley&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s not possible, is it?
      Anyway, I couldn&rsquo;t afford it now. So I thought I&rsquo;d stay here, if there was
      room for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to board here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put it to myself that way. I thought perhaps you&rsquo;d be glad to
      have me. I&rsquo;m handy. I can cook, I can sew, and I&rsquo;m quite cheerful and
      kind. Then there&rsquo;s George&mdash;little George. I thought you&rsquo;d like to
      have your grandson here with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived without him&mdash;or his father&mdash;for eight years, an&rsquo; I
      could bear it a while yet, mebbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a half-choking sound from the old woman in the rocking-chair,
      but she did not speak, though her knitting dropped into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you knew us better, perhaps you&rsquo;d like us better,&rdquo; rejoined Cassy
      gently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both pretty easy to get on with, and we see the bright side
      of things. He has a wonderful disposition, has George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to like you any better,&rdquo; said the old man, getting to his
      feet. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to give you any rights here. I&rsquo;ve thought it out, and
      my mind&rsquo;s made up. You can&rsquo;t come it over me. You ruined my boy&rsquo;s life and
      sent him to his grave. He&rsquo;d have lived to be an old man out here; but you
      spoiled him. You trapped him into marrying you, with your kicking and your
      comic songs, and your tricks of the stage, and you parted us&mdash;parted
      him and me for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was your fault. George wanted to make it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you!&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s voice rose shrilly, the bitterness and passion
      of years was shooting high in the narrow confines of his mind. The geyser
      of his prejudice and antipathy was furiously alive. &ldquo;To come back with you
      that ruined him and broke up my family, and made my life like bitter
      aloes! No! And if I wouldn&rsquo;t have him with you, do you think I&rsquo;ll have you
      without him? By the God of Israel, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Andy was now standing up behind the stove intently watching, his
      face grim and sombre; Aunt Kate sat with both hands gripping the arms of
      the rocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassy got slowly to her feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been as straight a woman as your
      mother or your wife ever was,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and all the world knows it. I&rsquo;m
      poor&mdash;and I might have been rich. I was true to myself before I
      married George, and I was true to George after, and all I earned he
      shared; and I&rsquo;ve got little left. The mining stock I bought with what I
      saved went smash, and I&rsquo;m poor as I was when I started to work for myself.
      I can work awhile yet, but I wanted to see if I could fit in out here, and
      get well again, and have my boy fixed in the house of his grandfather.
      That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m placed, and that&rsquo;s how I came. But give a dog a bad
      name&mdash;ah, you shame your dead boy in thinking bad of me! I didn&rsquo;t
      ruin him. I didn&rsquo;t kill him. He never came to any bad through me. I helped
      him; he was happy. Why, I&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly, putting a hand to
      her mouth. &ldquo;Go on, say what you want to say, and let&rsquo;s understand once for
      all,&rdquo; she added with a sudden sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Baragar drew himself up. &ldquo;Well, I say this. I&rsquo;ll give you three
      thousand dollars, and you can go somewhere else to live. I&rsquo;ll keep the boy
      here. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve fixed in my mind to do. You can go, and the boy
      stays. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to live with you that spoiled George&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the woman dilated, she trembled with a sudden rush of anger,
      then stood still, staring in front of her without a word. Black Andy
      stepped from behind the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to stay here, Cassy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;here where you have rights
      as good as any, and better than any, if it comes to that.&rdquo; He turned to
      his father. &ldquo;You thought a lot of George,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He was the apple of
      your eye. He had a soft tongue, and most people liked him; but George was
      foolish&mdash;I&rsquo;ve known it all these years. George was pretty foolish. He
      gambled, he bet at races, he speculated&mdash;wild. You didn&rsquo;t know it. He
      took ten thousand dollars of your money, got from the Wonegosh farm he
      sold for you. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cassy Mavor started forwards with a cry, but Black Andy waved her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to tell it. George lost your ten thousand dollars, dad,
      gambling, racing, speculating. He told her&mdash;Cassy-two days after they
      was married, and she took the money she earned on the stage, and give it
      to him to pay you back on the quiet through the bank. You never knew, but
      that&rsquo;s the kind of boy your son George was, and that&rsquo;s the kind of wife he
      had. George told me all about it when I was East six years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came over to Cassy and stood beside her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing by George&rsquo;s
      wife,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand, while she shut her eyes in her misery&mdash;had
      she not hid her husband&rsquo;s wrong-doing all these years? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing by
      her. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that ten thousand dollars she paid back for
      George, you&rsquo;d have been swamped when the Syndicate got after you, and we
      wouldn&rsquo;t have had Lumley&rsquo;s place, nor this, nor anything. I guess she&rsquo;s
      got rights here, dad, as good as any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man sank slowly into a chair. &ldquo;George&mdash;George stole from me&mdash;stole
      money from me!&rdquo; he whispered. His face was white. His pride and vainglory
      were broken. He was a haggard, shaken figure. His self-righteousness was
      levelled in the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sudden impulse, Cassy stole over to him, and took his hand and held
      it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t feel so bad!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was weak and wild then. But he
      was all right afterwards. He was happy with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve owed Cassy this for a good many years, dad,&rdquo; said Black Andy, &ldquo;and
      it had to be paid. She&rsquo;s got better stuff in her than any Baragar.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        .........................
</pre>
    <p>
      An hour later, the old man said to Cassy at the door of her room: &ldquo;You got
      to stay here and git well. It&rsquo;s yours, the same as the rest of us&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went downstairs and sat with Aunt Kate by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s a good woman,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use her right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been lucky with your women-folk,&rdquo; Aunt Kate answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been lucky,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I dunno if I deserve it. Mebbe not.
      Do you think she&rsquo;ll git well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a healing air out here,&rdquo; Aunt Kate answered, and listened to the
      wood of the house snapping in the sharp frost.

    <h2>
      MARCILE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That the day was beautiful, that the harvest of the West had been a great
      one, that the salmon-fishing had been larger than ever before, that gold
      had been found in the Yukon, made no difference to Jacques Grassette, for
      he was in the condemned cell of Bindon Jail, living out those days which
      pass so swiftly between the verdict of the jury and the last slow walk
      with the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat with his back to the stone wall, his hands on his knees, looking
      straight before him. All that met his physical gaze was another stone
      wall, but with his mind&rsquo;s eye he was looking beyond it into spaces far
      away. His mind was seeing a little house with dormer windows, and a steep
      roof on which the snow could not lodge in winter-time; with a narrow stoop
      in front where one could rest of an evening, the day&rsquo;s work done; the
      stone-and-earth oven near by in the open, where the bread for a family of
      twenty was baked; the wooden plough tipped against the fence, to wait the
      &ldquo;fall&rdquo; cultivation; the big iron cooler in which the sap from the maple
      trees was boiled, in the days when the snow thawed and spring opened the
      heart of the wood; the flash of the sickle and the scythe hard by; the
      fields of the little narrow farm running back from the St. Lawrence like a
      riband; and, out on the wide stream, the great rafts with their riverine
      population floating down to Michelin&rsquo;s mill-yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he had sat like this, unmoving, his gnarled red hands clamping
      each leg as though to hold him steady while he gazed; and he saw himself
      as a little lad, barefooted, doing chores, running after the shaggy,
      troublesome pony which would let him catch it when no one else could, and,
      with only a halter on, galloping wildly back to the farmyard, to be
      hitched up in the carriole which had once belonged to the old Seigneur. He
      saw himself as a young man, back from &ldquo;the States&rdquo; where he had been
      working in the mills, regarded austerely by little Father Roche, who had
      given him his first Communion&mdash;for, down in Massachusetts he had
      learned to wear his curly hair plastered down on his forehead, smoke bad
      cigars, and drink &ldquo;old Bourbon,&rdquo; to bet and to gamble, and be a figure at
      horse-races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw himself, his money all gone, but the luck still with him, at
      Mass on the Sunday before going to the backwoods lumber-camp for the
      winter, as boss of a hundred men. He had a way with him, and he had
      brains, had Jacques Grassette, and he could manage men, as Michelin the
      lumber-king himself had found in a great river-row and strike, when
      bloodshed seemed certain. Even now the ghost of a smile played at his
      lips, as he recalled the surprise of the old habitants and of Father Roche
      when he was chosen for this responsible post; for to run a great
      lumber-camp well, hundreds of miles from civilisation, where there is no
      visible law, no restraints of ordinary organised life, and where men, for
      seven months together, never saw a woman or a child, and ate pork and
      beans, and drank white whisky, was a task of administration as difficult
      as managing a small republic new-created out of violent elements of
      society. But Michelin was right, and the old Seigneur, Sir Henri
      Robitaille, who was a judge of men, knew he was right, as did also
      Hennepin the schoolmaster, whose despair Jacques had been, for he never
      worked at his lessons as a boy, and yet he absorbed Latin and mathematics
      by some sure but unexplainable process. &ldquo;Ah! if you would but work,
      Jacques, you vaurien, I would make a great man of you,&rdquo; Hennepin had said
      to him more than once; but this had made no impression on Jacques. It was
      more to the point that the ground-hogs and black squirrels and pigeons
      were plentiful in Casanac Woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he thought as he stood at the door of the Church of St. Francis on
      that day before going &ldquo;out back&rdquo; to the lumber-camp. He had reached the
      summit of greatness&mdash;to command men. That was more than wealth or
      learning, and as he spoke to the old Seigneur going in to Mass, he still
      thought so, for the Seigneur&rsquo;s big house and the servants and the great
      gardens had no charm for him. The horses&mdash;that was another thing; but
      there would be plenty of horses in the lumber-camp; and, on the whole, he
      felt himself rather superior to the old Seigneur, who now was
      Lieutenant-Governor of the province in which lay Bindon Jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the Church of St. Francis he had stretched himself up with
      good-natured pride, for he was by nature gregarious and friendly, but with
      a temper quick and strong, and even savage when roused; though Michelin
      the lumber-king did not know that when he engaged him as boss, having seen
      him only at the one critical time, when his superior brain and will saw
      its chance to command, and had no personal interest in the strife. He had
      been a miracle of coolness then, and his six-foot-two of pride and muscle
      was taking natural tribute at the door of the Church of St. Francis, where
      he waited till nearly everyone had entered, and Father Roche&rsquo;s voice could
      be heard in the Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then had happened the real event of his life: a blackeyed, rose-checked
      girl went by with her mother, hurrying in to Mass. As she passed him their
      eyes met, and his blood leapt in his veins. He had never seen her before,
      and, in a sense, he had never seen any woman before. He had danced with
      many a one, and kissed a few in the old days among the flax-beaters, at
      the harvesting, in the gaieties of a wedding, and also down in
      Massachusetts. That, however, was a different thing, which he forgot an
      hour after; but this was the beginning of the world for him; for he knew
      now, of a sudden, what life was, what home meant, why &ldquo;old folks&rdquo; slaved
      for their children, and mothers wept when girls married or sons went away
      from home to bigger things; why in there, in at Mass, so many were praying
      for all the people, and thinking only of one. All in a moment it came&mdash;and
      stayed; and he spoke to her, to Marcile, that very night, and he spoke
      also to her father, Valloir the farrier, the next morning by lamplight,
      before he started for the woods. He would not be gainsaid, nor take no for
      an answer, nor accept, as a reason for refusal, that she was only sixteen,
      and that he did not know her, for she had been away with a childless aunt
      since she was three. That she had fourteen brothers and sisters who had to
      be fed and cared for did not seem to weigh with the farrier. That was an
      affair of le bon Dieu, and enough would be provided for them all as
      heretofore&mdash;one could make little difference; and though Jacques was
      a very good match, considering his prospects and his favour with the
      lumber-king, Valloir had a kind of fear of him, and could not easily
      promise his beloved Marcile, the flower of his flock, to a man of whom the
      priest so strongly disapproved. But it was a new sort of Jacques Grassette
      who, that morning, spoke to him with the simplicity and eagerness of a
      child; and the suddenly conceived gift of a pony stallion, which every man
      in the parish envied Jacques, won Valloir over; and Jacques went &ldquo;away
      back&rdquo; with the first timid kiss of Marcile Valloir burning on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, bagosh, you are a wonder!&rdquo; said Jacques&rsquo; father, when he told him
      the news, and saw Jacques jump into the carriole and drive away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in prison, this, too, Jacques saw&mdash;this scene; and then the
      wedding in the spring, and the tour through the parishes for days
      together, lads and lasses journeying with them; and afterwards the new
      home with a bigger stoop than any other in the village, with some old
      gnarled crab-apple trees and lilac bushes, and four years of happiness,
      and a little child that died; and all the time Jacques rising in the
      esteem of Michelin the lumber-king, and sent on inspections, and to
      organise camps; for weeks, sometimes for months, away from the house
      behind the lilac bushes&mdash;and then the end of it all, sudden and
      crushing and unredeemable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques came back one night and found the house empty. Marcile had gone to
      try her luck with another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the end of the upward career of Jacques Grassette. He went out
      upon a savage hunt which brought him no quarry, for the man and the woman
      had disappeared as completely as though they had been swallowed by the
      sea. And here, at last, he was waiting for the day when he must settle a
      bill for a human life taken in passion and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      His big frame seemed out of place in the small cell, and the watcher
      sitting near him, to whom he had not addressed a word nor replied to a
      question since the watching began, seemed an insignificant factor in the
      scene. Never had a prisoner been more self-contained, or rejected more
      completely all those ministrations of humanity which relieve the horrible
      isolation of the condemned cell. Grassette&rsquo;s isolation was complete. He
      lived in a dream, did what little there was to do in a dark abstraction,
      and sat hour after hour, as he was sitting now, piercing, with a brain at
      once benumbed to all outer things and afire with inward things, those
      realms of memory which are infinite in a life of forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacre!&rdquo; he muttered at last, and a shiver seemed to pass through him from
      head to foot; then an ugly and evil oath fell from his lips, which made
      his watcher shrink back appalled, for he also was a Catholic, and had been
      chosen of purpose, in the hope that he might have an influence on this
      revolted soul. It had, however, been of no use, and Grassette had refused
      the advances and ministrations of the little good priest, Father Laflamme,
      who had come from the coast of purpose to give him the offices of the
      Church. Silent, obdurate, sullen, he had looked the priest straight in the
      face and had said in broken English, &ldquo;Non, I pay my bill. Nom de diable, I
      will say my own Mass, light my own candle, go my own way. I have too
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, as he sat glooming, after his outbreak of oaths, there came a
      rattling noise at the door, the grinding of a key in the lock, the
      shooting of bolts, and a face appeared at the little wicket in the door.
      Then the door opened and the Sheriff stepped inside, accompanied by a
      white-haired, stately old man. At sight of this second figure&mdash;the
      Sheriff had come often before, and would come for one more doleful walk
      with him&mdash;Grassette started. His face, which had never whitened in
      all the dismal and terrorising doings of the capture and the trial and
      sentence, though it had flushed with rage more than once, now turned a
      little pale, for it seemed as if this old man had stepped out of the
      visions which had just passed before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Honour, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Henri Robitaille, has come to
      speak with you.... Stand up,&rdquo; the Sheriff added sharply, as Grassette kept
      his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grassette&rsquo;s face flushed with anger, for the prison had not broken his
      spirits; then he got up slowly. &ldquo;I not stand up for you,&rdquo; he growled at
      the Sheriff; &ldquo;I stand up for him.&rdquo; He jerked his head towards Sir Henri
      Robitaille. This grand Seigneur, with Michelin, had believed in him in
      those far-off days which he had just been seeing over again, and all his
      boyhood and young manhood was rushing back on him. But now it was the
      Governor who turned pale, seeing who the criminal was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques Grassette!&rdquo; he cried in consternation and emotion, for under
      another name the murderer had been tried and sentenced, nor had his
      identity been established&mdash;the case was so clear, the defence had
      been perfunctory, and Quebec was very far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;!&rdquo; was the respectful response, and Grassette&rsquo;s fingers twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my sister&rsquo;s son you killed, Grassette,&rdquo; said the Governor in a
      low, strained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nom de Dieu!&rdquo; said Grassette hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know, Grassette,&rdquo; the Governor went on &ldquo;I did not know it was
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him &lsquo;your Honour,&rdquo;&rsquo; said the Sheriff sharply. Grassette&rsquo;s face
      hardened, and his look turned upon the Sheriff was savage and forbidding.
      &ldquo;I will speak as it please me. Who are you? What do I care? To hang me&mdash;that
      is your business; but, for the rest, you spik to me differen&rsquo;. Who are
      you? Your father kep&rsquo; a tavern for thieves, vous savez bien!&rdquo; It was true
      that the Sheriff&rsquo;s father had had no savoury reputation in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor turned his head away in pain and trouble, for the man&rsquo;s rage
      was not a thing to see&mdash;and they both came from the little parish of
      St. Francis, and had passed many an hour together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Grassette,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Call me what you will. You&rsquo;ve
      got no feeling against me; and I can say with truth that I don&rsquo;t want your
      life for the life you took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grassette&rsquo;s breast heaved. &ldquo;He put me out of my work, the man I kill. He
      pass the word against me, he hunt me out of the mountains, he call&mdash;tete
      de diable! he call me a name so bad. Everything swim in my head, and I
      kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor made a protesting gesture. &ldquo;I understand. I am glad his
      mother was dead. But do you not think how sudden it was? Now here, in the
      thick of life, then, out there, beyond this world in the darkin
      purgatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brave old man had accomplished what everyone else, priest, lawyer,
      Sheriff and watcher, had failed to do: he had shaken Grassette out of his
      blank isolation and obdurate unrepentance, had touched some chord of
      recognisable humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is done&mdash;well, I pay for it,&rdquo; responded Grassette, setting his
      jaw. &ldquo;It is two deaths for me. Waiting and remembering, and then with the
      Sheriff there the other&mdash;so quick, and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor looked at him for some moments without speaking. The Sheriff
      intervened again officiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Honour has come to say something important to you,&rdquo; he remarked
      oracularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold you&mdash;does he need a Sheriff to tell him when to spik?&rdquo; was
      Grassette&rsquo;s surly comment. Then he turned to the Governor. &ldquo;Let us speak
      in French,&rdquo; he said in patois. &ldquo;This rope-twister will not understan&rsquo;. He
      is no good&mdash;I spit at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor nodded, and, despite the Sheriff&rsquo;s protest, they spoke in
      French, Grassette with his eyes intently fixed on the other, eagerly
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said the Governor, &ldquo;to say to you, Grassette, that you have
      still a chance of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and Grassette&rsquo;s face took on a look of bewilderment and vague
      anxiety. A chance of life&mdash;what did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reprieve?&rdquo; he asked in a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor shook his head. &ldquo;Not yet; but there is a chance. Something
      has happened. A man&rsquo;s life is in danger, or it may be he is dead; but more
      likely he is alive. You took a life; perhaps you can save one now.
      Keeley&rsquo;s Gulch&mdash;the mine there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have found it&mdash;gold?&rdquo; asked Grassette, his eyes staring. He was
      forgetting for a moment where and what he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to find it, the man whose life is in danger. He had heard from a
      trapper who had been a miner once. While he was there, a landslip came,
      and the opening to the mine was closed up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were two ways in. Which one did he take?&rdquo; cried Grassette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only one he could take, the only one he or anyone else knew. You know
      the other way in&mdash;you only, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it&mdash;the easier, quick way in; a year ago I found it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it near the other entrance?&rdquo; Grassette shook his head. &ldquo;A mile away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the man is alive&mdash;and we think he is&mdash;you are the only
      person that can save him. I have telegraphed the Government. They do not
      promise, but they will reprieve, and save your life, if you find the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive or dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive or dead, for the act would be the same. I have an order to take you
      to the Gulch, if you will go; and I am sure that you will have your life,
      if you do it. I will promise&mdash;ah yes, Grassette, but it shall be so!
      Public opinion will demand it. You will do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go free&mdash;altogether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but if your life is saved, Grassette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark face flushed, then grew almost repulsive again in its sullenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life&mdash;and this, in prison, shut in year after year. To do always
      what some one else wills, to be a slave to a warder. To have men like that
      over me that have been a boss of men&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it that drove me to
      kill?&mdash;to be treated like dirt. And to go on with this, while outside
      there is free life, and to go where you will at your own price-no! What do
      I care for life! What is it to me! To live like this&mdash;ah, I would
      break my head against these stone walls, I would choke myself with my own
      hands! If I stayed here, I would kill again, I would kill&mdash;kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then to go free altogether&mdash;that would be the wish of all the world,
      if you save this man&rsquo;s life, if it can be saved. Will you not take the
      chance? We all have to die some time or other, Grassette, some sooner,
      some later; and when you go, will you not want to take to God in your
      hands a life saved for a life taken? Have you forgotten God, Grassette? We
      used to remember Him in the Church of St. Francis down there at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, in which Grassette&rsquo;s head was thrust
      forwards, his eyes staring into space. The old Seigneur had touched a
      vulnerable corner in his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he said in a low voice: &ldquo;To be free altogether.... What is his
      name? Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Bignold,&rdquo; the Governor answered. He turned to the Sheriff
      inquiringly. &ldquo;That is it, is it not?&rdquo; he asked in English again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James Tarran Bignold,&rdquo; answered the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of these words upon Grassette was remarkable. His body appeared
      to stiffen, his face became rigid, he stared at the Governor blankly,
      appalled, the colour left his face, and his mouth opened with a curious
      and revolting grimace. The others drew back, startled, and watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sang de Dieu!&rdquo; he murmured at last, with a sudden gesture of misery and
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Governor understood: he remembered that the name just given by
      the Sheriff and himself was the name of the Englishman who had carried off
      Grassette&rsquo;s wife years ago. He stepped forwards and was about to speak,
      but changed his mind. He would leave it all to Grassette; he would not let
      the Sheriff know the truth, unless Grassette himself disclosed the
      situation. He looked at Grassette with a look of poignant pity and
      interest combined. In his own placid life he had never had any tragic
      happening, his blood had run coolly, his days had been blessed by an
      urbane fate; such scenes as this were but a spectacle to him; there was no
      answering chord of human suffering in his own breast, to make him realise
      what Grassette was undergoing now; but he had read widely, he had been an
      acute observer of the world and its happenings, and he had a natural human
      sympathy which had made many a man and woman eternally grateful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would Grassette do? It was a problem which had no precedent, and the
      solution would be a revelation of the human mind and heart. What would the
      man do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is all this, Grassette?&rdquo; asked the Sheriff brusquely. His
      official and officious intervention, behind which was the tyranny of the
      little man, given a power which he was incapable of wielding wisely, would
      have roused Grassette to a savage reply a half-hour before, but now it was
      met by a contemptuous wave of the hand, and Grassette kept his eyes fixed
      on the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James Tarran Bignold!&rdquo; Grassette said harshly, with eyes that searched
      the Governor&rsquo;s face; but they found no answering look there. The Governor,
      then, did not remember that tragedy of his home and hearth, and the man
      who had made of him an Ishmael. Still, Bignold had been almost a stranger
      in the parish, and it was not curious if the Governor had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bignold!&rdquo; he repeated, but the Governor gave no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bignold is his name, Grassette,&rdquo; said the Sheriff. &ldquo;You took a life,
      and now, if you save one, that&rsquo;ll balance things. As the Governor says,
      there&rsquo;ll be a reprieve anyhow. It&rsquo;s pretty near the day, and this isn&rsquo;t a
      bad world to kick in, so long as you kick with one leg on the ground, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor hastily intervened upon the Sheriff&rsquo;s brutal remarks. &ldquo;There
      is no time to be lost, Grassette. He has been ten days in the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grassette&rsquo;s was not a slow brain. For a man of such physical and bodily
      bulk, he had more talents than are generally given. If his brain had been
      slower, his hand also would have been slower to strike. But his
      intelligence had been surcharged with hate these many years, and since the
      day he had been deserted, it had ceased to control his actions&mdash;a
      passionate and reckless wilfulness had governed it. But now, after the
      first shock and stupefaction, it seemed to go back to where it was before
      Marcile went from him, gather up the force and intelligence it had then,
      and come forwards again to this supreme moment, with all that life&rsquo;s harsh
      experiences had done for it, with the education that misery and misdoing
      give. Revolutions are often the work of instants, not years, and the
      crucial test and problem by which Grassette was now faced had lifted him
      into a new atmosphere, with a new capacity alive in him. A moment ago his
      eyes had been bloodshot and swimming with hatred and passion; now they
      grew, almost suddenly, hard and lurking and quiet, with a strange,
      penetrating force and inquiry in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bignold&mdash;where does he come from? What is he?&rdquo; he asked the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an Englishman; he&rsquo;s only been out here a few months. He&rsquo;s been
      shooting and prospecting; but he&rsquo;s a better shooter than prospector. He&rsquo;s
      a stranger; that&rsquo;s why all the folks out here want to save him if it&rsquo;s
      possible. It&rsquo;s pretty hard dying in a strange land far away from all
      that&rsquo;s yours. Maybe he&rsquo;s got a wife waiting for him over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nom de Dieu!&rdquo; said Grassette with suppressed malice, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a wife waiting for him, and there&rsquo;s her to think of. The
      West&rsquo;s hospitable, and this thing has taken hold of it; the West wants to
      save this stranger, and it&rsquo;s waiting for you, Grassette, to do its work
      for it, you being the only man that can do it, the only one that knows the
      other secret way into Keeley&rsquo;s Gulch. Speak right out, Grassette. It&rsquo;s
      your chance for life. Speak out quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last three words were uttered in the old slave-driving tone, though
      the earlier part of the speech had been delivered oracularly, and had
      brought again to Grassette&rsquo;s eyes the reddish, sullen look which had made
      them, a little while before, like those of some wounded, angered animal at
      bay; but it vanished slowly, and there was silence for a moment. The
      Sheriff&rsquo;s words had left no vestige of doubt in Grassette&rsquo;s mind. This
      Bignold was the man who had taken Marcile away, first to the English
      province, then into the States, where he had lost track of them, then over
      to England. Marcile&mdash;where was Marcile now?
    </p>
    <p>
      In Keeley&rsquo;s Gulch was the man who could tell him, the man who had ruined
      his home and his life. Dead or alive, he was in Keeley&rsquo;s Gulch, the man
      who knew where Marcile was; and if he knew where Marcile was, and if she
      was alive, and he was outside these prison walls, what would he do to her?
      And if he was outside these prison walls, and in the Gulch, and the man
      was there alive before him, what would he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside these prison walls-to be out there in the sun, where life would be
      easier to give up, if it had to be given up! An hour ago he had been
      drifting on a sea of apathy, and had had his fill of life. An hour ago he
      had had but one desire, and that was to die fighting, and he had even
      pictured to himself a struggle in this narrow cell where he would compel
      them to kill him, and so in any case let him escape the rope. Now he was
      suddenly brought face to face with the great central issue of his life,
      and the end, whatever that end might be, could not be the same in meaning,
      though it might be the same concretely. If he elected to let things be,
      then Bignold would die out there in the Gulch, starved, anguished, and
      alone. If he went, he could save his own life by saving Bignold, if
      Bignold was alive; or he could go&mdash;and not save Bignold&rsquo;s life or his
      own! What would he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor watched him with a face controlled to quietness, but with an
      anxiety which made him pale in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, Grassette?&rdquo; he said at last in a low voice, and with a
      step forwards to him. &ldquo;Will you not help to clear your conscience by doing
      this thing? You don&rsquo;t want to try and spite the world by not doing it. You
      can make a lot of your life yet, if you are set free. Give yourself, and
      give the world a chance. You haven&rsquo;t used it right. Try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grassette imagined that the Governor did not remember who Bignold was, and
      that this was an appeal against his despair, and against revenging himself
      on the community which had applauded his sentence. If he went to the
      Gulch, no one would know or could suspect the true situation, everyone
      would be unprepared for that moment when Bignold and he would face each
      other&mdash;and all that would happen then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was Marcile? Only Bignold knew. Alive or dead? Only Bignold knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, I will do it, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said to the Governor. &ldquo;I am to go alone&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff shook his head. &ldquo;No, two warders will go with you&mdash;and
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange look passed over Grassette&rsquo;s face. He seemed to hesitate for a
      moment, then he said again: &ldquo;Bon, I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is, of course, the doctor,&rdquo; said the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon,&rdquo; said Grassette. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; answered the
      Sheriff, and made a motion to the warder to open the door of the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By sundown!&rdquo; Grassette said, and he turned with a determined gesture to
      leave the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of the prison, a fresh, sweet air caught his face.
      Involuntarily he drew in a great draught of it, and his eyes seemed to
      gaze out, almost wonderingly, over the grass and the trees to the
      boundless horizon. Then he became aware of the shouts of the crowd&mdash;shouts
      of welcome. This same crowd had greeted him with shouts of execration when
      he had left the Court House after his sentence. He stood still for a
      moment and looked at them, as it were only half comprehending that they
      were cheering him now, and that voices were saying, &ldquo;Bravo, Grassette!
      Save him, and we&rsquo;ll save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cheer upon cheer, but he took no notice. He walked like one in a dream, a
      long, strong step. He turned neither to left nor right, not even when the
      friendly voice of one who had worked with him bade him: &ldquo;Cheer up, and do
      the trick.&rdquo; He was busy working out a problem which no one but himself
      could solve. He was only half conscious of his surroundings; he was moving
      in a kind of detached world of his own, where the warders and the Sheriff
      and those who followed were almost abstract and unreal figures. He was
      living with a past which had been everlasting distant, and had now become
      a vivid and buffeting present. He returned no answers to the questions
      addressed to him, and would not talk, save when for a little while they
      dismounted from their horses, and sat under the shade of a great ash-tree
      for a few moments, and snatched a mouthful of luncheon. Then he spoke a
      little and asked some questions, but lapsed into a moody silence
      afterwards. His life and nature were being passed through a fiery
      crucible. In all the years that had gone, he had had an ungovernable
      desire to kill both Bignold and Marcile if he ever met them, a primitive,
      savage desire to blot them out of life and being. His fingers had ached
      for Marcile&rsquo;s neck, that neck in which he had lain his face so often in
      the transient, unforgettable days of their happiness. If she was alive now&mdash;if
      she was still alive! Her story was hidden there in Keeley&rsquo;s Gulch with
      Bignold, and he was galloping hard to reach his foe. As he went, by some
      strange alchemy of human experience, by that new birth of his brain, the
      world seemed different from what it had ever been before, at least since
      the day when he had found an empty home and a shamed hearthstone. He got a
      new feeling toward it, and life appealed to him as a thing that might have
      been so well worth living. But since that was not to be, then he would see
      what he could do to get compensation for all that he had lost, to take
      toll for the thing that had spoiled him, and given him a savage nature and
      a raging temper, which had driven him at last to kill a man who, in no
      real sense, had injured him.
    </p>

      Mile after mile they journeyed, a troop of interested people coming after,
      the sun and the clear sweet air, the waving grass, the occasional
      clearings where settlers had driven in the tent-pegs of home, the forest
      now and then swallowing them, the mountains rising above them like a blank
      wall, and then suddenly opening out before them; and the rustle and
      scamper of squirrels and coyotes; and over their heads the whistle of
      birds, the slow beat of wings of great wild-fowl. The tender sap of youth
      was in this glowing and alert new world, and, by sudden contrast with the
      prison walls which he had just left behind, the earth seemed recreated,
      unfamiliar, compelling and companionable. Strange that in all the years
      that had been since he had gone back to his abandoned home to find Marcile
      gone, the world had had no beauty, no lure for him. In the splendour of it
      all, he had only raged and stormed, hating his fellowman, waiting, however
      hopelessly, for the day when he should see Marcile and the man who had
      taken her from him. And yet now, under the degradation of his crime and
      its penalty, and the unmanning influence of being the helpless victim of
      the iron power of the law, rigid, ugly and demoralising&mdash;now with the
      solution of his life&rsquo;s great problem here before him in the hills, with
      the man for whom he had waited so long caverned in the earth, but a
      hand-reach away, as it were, his wrongs had taken a new manifestation in
      him, and the thing that kept crying out in him every moment was, Where is
      Marcile?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four o&rsquo;clock when they reached the pass which only Grassette knew,
      the secret way into the Gulch. There was two hours&rsquo; walking through the
      thick, primeval woods, where few had ever been, except the ancient tribes
      which had once lorded it here; then came a sudden drop into the earth, a
      short travel through a dim cave, and afterward a sheer wall of stone
      enclosing a ravine where the rocks on either side nearly met overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Grassette gave the signal to shout aloud, and the voice of the
      Sheriff called out: &ldquo;Hello, Bignold!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Hello, Bignold! Are you there?&mdash;Hello!&rdquo; His voice rang out
      clear and piercing, and then came a silence-a long, anxious silence. Again
      the voice rang out: &ldquo;Hello! Hello-o-o! Bignold! Bigno-o-ld!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They strained their ears. Grassette was flat on the ground, his ear to the
      earth. Suddenly he got to his feet, his face set, his eyes glittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there beyon&rsquo;&mdash;I hear him,&rdquo; he said, pointing farther down the
      Gulch. &ldquo;Water&mdash;he is near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard nothing,&rdquo; said the Sheriff, &ldquo;not a sound.&rdquo; &ldquo;I hear ver&rsquo; good. He
      is alive. I hear him&mdash;so,&rdquo; responded Grassette; and his face had a
      strange, fixed look which the others interpreted to be agitation at the
      thought that he had saved his own life by finding Bignold&mdash;and alive;
      which would put his own salvation beyond doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke away from them and hurried down the Gulch. The others followed
      hard after, the Sheriff and the warders close behind; but he outstripped
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stopped and stood still, looking at something on the ground.
      They saw him lean forwards and his hands stretch out with a fierce
      gesture. It was the attitude of a wild animal ready to spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were beside him in an instant, and saw at his feet Bignold worn to a
      skeleton, with eyes starting from his head, and fixed on Grassette in
      agony and stark fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff stooped to lift Bignold up, but Grassette waved them back with
      a fierce gesture, standing over the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoil my home. He break me&mdash;I have my bill to settle here,&rdquo; he
      said in a voice hoarse and harsh. &ldquo;It is so? It is so&mdash;eh? Spik!&rdquo; he
      said to Bignold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came feebly from the shrivelled lips. &ldquo;Water! Water!&rdquo; the wretched
      man gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden change came over Grassette. &ldquo;Water&mdash;queeck!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff stooped and held a hatful of water to Bignold&rsquo;s lips, while
      another poured brandy from a flask into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grassette watched them eagerly. When the dying man had swallowed a little
      of the spirit and water, Grassette leaned over him again, and the others
      drew away. They realised that these two men had an account to settle, and
      there was no need for Grassette to take revenge, for Bignold was going
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stan&rsquo; far back,&rdquo; said Grassette, and they fell away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stooped down to the sunken, ashen face, over which death was fast
      drawing its veil. &ldquo;Marcile&mdash;where is Marcile?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dying man&rsquo;s lips opened. &ldquo;God forgive me&mdash;God save my soul!&rdquo; he
      whispered. He was not concerned for Grassette now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queeck-queeck, where is Marcile?&rdquo; Grassette said sharply. &ldquo;Come back,
      Bignold. Listen&mdash;where is Marcile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strained to hear the answer. Bignold was going, but his eyes opened
      again, however, for this call seemed to pierce to his soul as it struggled
      to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years&mdash;since&mdash;I saw her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Good girl&mdash;Marcile.
      She loves you, but she&mdash;is afraid.&rdquo; He tried to say something more,
      but his tongue refused its office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she-spik!&rdquo; commanded Grassette in a tone of pleading and agony
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the flying spirit came back. A hand made a motion towards his
      pocket, then lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grassette felt hastily in the dead man&rsquo;s pocket, drew forth a letter, and
      with half-blinded eyes read the few lines it contained. It was dated from
      a hospital in New York, and was signed: &ldquo;Nurse Marcile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a moan of relief Grassette stood staring at the dead man. When the
      others came to him again, his lips were moving, but they did not hear what
      he was saying. They took up the body and moved away with it up the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Grassette. You&rsquo;ll be a freeman,&rdquo; said the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grassette did not answer. He was thinking how long it would take him to
      get to Marcile, when he was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a true vision of beginning life again with Marcile.

    <h2>
      A MAN, A FAMINE, AND A HEATHEN BOY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Athabasca in the Far North is the scene of this story&mdash;Athabasca, one
      of the most beautiful countries in the world in summer, but a cold, bare
      land in winter. Yet even in winter it is not so bleak and bitter as the
      districts south-west of it, for the Chinook winds steal through from the
      Pacific and temper the fierceness of the frozen Rockies. Yet forty and
      fifty degrees below zero is cold after all, and July strawberries in this
      wild North land are hardly compensation for seven months of ice and snow,
      no matter how clear and blue the sky, how sweet the sun during its short
      journey in the day. Some days, too, the sun may not be seen even when
      there is no storm, because of the fine, white, powdered frost in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day like this is called a poudre day; and woe to the man who tempts it
      unthinkingly, because the light makes the delicate mist of frost shine
      like silver. For that powder bites the skin white in short order, and
      sometimes reckless men lose ears, or noses, or hands under its sharp
      caress. But when it really storms in that Far North, then neither man nor
      beast should be abroad&mdash;not even the Eskimo dogs; though times and
      seasons can scarcely be chosen when travelling in Athabasca, for a storm
      comes unawares. Upon the plains you will see a cloud arising, not in the
      sky, but from the ground&mdash;a billowy surf of drifting snow; then
      another white billow from the sky will sweep down and meet it, and you are
      caught between.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who went to Athabasca to live a generation ago had to ask himself if
      the long winter, spent chiefly indoors, with, maybe, a little trading with
      the Indians, meagre sport, and scant sun, savages and half-breeds the only
      companions, and out of all touch with the outside world, letters coming
      but once a year; with frozen fish and meat, always the same, as the staple
      items in a primitive fare; with danger from starvation and marauding
      tribes; with endless monotony, in which men sometimes go mad&mdash;he had
      to ask himself if these were to be cheerfully endured because, in the
      short summer, the air is heavenly, the rivers and lakes are full of fish,
      the flotilla of canoes of the fur-hunters is pouring down, and all is
      gaiety and pleasant turmoil; because there is good shooting in the autumn,
      and the smell of the land is like a garden, and hardy fruits and flowers
      are at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is a question which was asked William Rufus Holly once upon a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Rufus Holly, often called &ldquo;Averdoopoy,&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;Sleeping
      Beauty,&rdquo; always Billy Rufus, had had a good education. He had been to high
      school and to college, and he had taken one or two prizes en route to
      graduation; but no fame travelled with him, save that he was the laziest
      man of any college year for a decade. He loved his little porringer, which
      is to say that he ate a good deal; and he loved to read books, which is
      not to say that he loved study; he hated getting out of bed, and he was
      constantly gated for morning chapel. More than once he had sweetly gone to
      sleep over his examination papers. This is not to say that he failed at
      his examinations&mdash;on the contrary, he always succeeded; but he only
      did enough to pass and no more; and he did not wish to do more than pass.
      His going to sleep at examinations was evidence that he was either
      indifferent or self-indulgent, and it certainly showed that he was without
      nervousness. He invariably roused himself, or his professor roused him, a
      half-hour before the papers should be handed in, and, as it were by a
      mathematical calculation, he had always done just enough to prevent him
      being plucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept at lectures, he slept in hall, he slept as he waited his turn to
      go to the wicket in a cricket match, and he invariably went to sleep
      afterwards. He even did so on the day he had made the biggest score, in
      the biggest game ever played between his college and the pick of the
      country; but he first gorged himself with cake and tea. The day he took
      his degree he had to be dragged from a huge grandfather&rsquo;s chair, and
      forced along in his ragged gown&mdash;&ldquo;ten holes and twelve tatters&rdquo;&mdash;to
      the function in the convocation hall. He looked so fat and shiny, so balmy
      and sleepy when he took his degree and was handed his prize for a poem on
      Sir John Franklin, that the public laughed, and the college men in the
      gallery began singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Bye O, my baby,
          Father will come to you soo-oon!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He seemed not to care, but yawned in his hand as he put his prize book
      under his arm through one of the holes in his gown, and in two minutes was
      back in his room, and in another five was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the general opinion that William Rufus Holly, fat, yellow-haired,
      and twenty-four years old, was doomed to failure in life, in spite of the
      fact that he had a little income of a thousand dollars a year, and had
      made a century in an important game of cricket. Great, therefore, was the
      surprise of the college, and afterward of the Province, when, at the
      farewell dinner of the graduates, Sleeping Beauty announced, between his
      little open-eyed naps, that he was going Far North as a missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it was thought he was joking, but when at last, in his calm and
      dreamy look, they saw he meant what he said, they rose and carried him
      round the room on a chair, making impromptu songs as they travelled. They
      toasted Billy Rufus again and again, some of them laughing till they cried
      at the thought of Averdoopoy going to the Arctic regions. But an uneasy
      seriousness fell upon these &ldquo;beautiful, bountiful, brilliant boys,&rdquo; as
      Holly called them later, when in a simple, honest, but indolent speech he
      said he had applied for ordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months later William Rufus Holly, a deacon in holy orders, journeyed
      to Athabasca in the Far North. On his long journey there was plenty of
      time to think. He was embarked on a career which must for ever keep him in
      the wilds; for very seldom indeed does a missionary of the North ever
      return to the crowded cities or take a permanent part in civilised life.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the loneliness of it would be he began to feel, as for hours and
      hours he saw no human being on the plains; in the thrilling stillness of
      the night; in fierce storms in the woods, when his half-breed guides bent
      their heads to meet the wind and rain, and did not speak for hours; in the
      long, adventurous journey on the river by day, in the cry of the plaintive
      loon at night; in the scant food for every meal. Yet what the pleasure
      would be he felt in the joyous air, the exquisite sunshine, the flocks of
      wild-fowl flying North, honking on their course; in the song of the
      half-breeds as they ran the rapids. Of course, he did not think these
      things quite as they are written here&mdash;all at once and all together;
      but in little pieces from time to time, feeling them rather than saying
      them to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least he did understand how serious a thing it was, his going as a
      missionary into the Far North. Why did he do it? Was it a whim, or the
      excited imagination of youth, or that prompting which the young often have
      to make the world better? Or was it a fine spirit of adventure with a good
      heart behind it? Perhaps it was a little of all these; but there was also
      something more, and it was to his credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lazy as William Rufus Holly had been at school and college, he had still
      thought a good deal, even when he seemed only sleeping; perhaps he thought
      more because he slept so much, because he studied little and read a great
      deal. He always knew what everybody thought&mdash;that he would never do
      anything but play cricket till he got too heavy to run, and then would
      sink into a slothful, fat, and useless middle and old age; that his life
      would be a failure. And he knew that they were right; that if he stayed
      where he could live an easy life, a fat and easy life he would lead; that
      in a few years he would be good for nothing except to eat and sleep&mdash;no
      more. One day, waking suddenly from a bad dream of himself so fat as to be
      drawn about on a dray by monstrous fat oxen with rings through their
      noses, led by monkeys, he began to wonder what he should do&mdash;the
      hardest thing to do; for only the hardest life could possibly save him
      from failure, and, in spite of all, he really did want to make something
      of his life. He had been reading the story of Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s Arctic
      expedition, and all at once it came home to him that the only thing for
      him to do was to go to the Far North and stay there, coming back about
      once every ten years to tell the people in the cities what was being done
      in the wilds. Then there came the inspiration to write his poem on Sir
      John Franklin, and he had done so, winning the college prize for poetry.
      But no one had seen any change in him in those months; and, indeed, there
      had been little or no change, for he had an equable and practical, though
      imaginative, disposition, despite his avoirdupois, and his new purpose did
      not stir him yet from his comfortable sloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in all the journey West and North he had not been stirred greatly from
      his ease of body, for the journey was not much harder than playing cricket
      every day, and there were only the thrill of the beautiful air, the new
      people, and the new scenes to rouse him. As yet there was no great
      responsibility. He scarcely realised what his life must be, until one
      particular day. Then Sleeping Beauty waked wide up, and from that day lost
      the name. Till then he had looked and borne himself like any other
      traveller, unrecognised as a parson or &ldquo;mikonaree.&rdquo; He had not had prayers
      in camp en route, he had not preached, he had held no meetings. He was as
      yet William Rufus Holly, the cricketer, the laziest dreamer of a college
      decade. His religion was simple and practical; he had never had any morbid
      ideas; he had lived a healthy, natural, and honourable life, until he went
      for a mikonaree, and if he had no cant, he had not a clear idea of how
      many-sided, how responsible, his life must be&mdash;until that one
      particular day. This is what happened then.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Fort O&rsquo;Call, an abandoned post of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company on the
      Peace River, nearly the whole tribe of the Athabasca Indians in possession
      of the post now had come up the river, with their chief,
      Knife-in-the-Wind, to meet the mikonaree. Factors of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
      Company, coureurs de bois, and voyageurs had come among them at times, and
      once the renowned Father Lacombe, the Jesuit priest, had stayed with them
      three months; but never to this day had they seen a Protestant mikonaree,
      though once a factor, noted for his furious temper, his powers of running,
      and his generosity, had preached to them. These men, however, were both
      over fifty years old. The Athabascas did not hunger for the Christian
      religion, but a courier from Edmonton had brought them word that a
      mikonaree was coming to their country to stay, and they put off their
      stoical manner and allowed themselves the luxury of curiosity. That was
      why even the squaws and papooses came up the river with the braves, all
      wondering if the stranger had brought gifts with him, all eager for their
      shares; for it had been said by the courier of the tribe that
      &ldquo;Oshondonto,&rdquo; their name for the newcomer, was bringing mysterious loads
      of well-wrapped bales and skins. Upon a point below the first rapids of
      the Little Manitou they waited with their camp-fires burning and their
      pipe of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the canoes bearing Oshondonto and his voyageurs shot the rapids to
      the song of the river,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;En roulant, ma boule roulant,
          En roulant, ma boule!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      with the shrill voices of the boatmen rising to meet the cry of the
      startled water-fowl, the Athabascas crowded to the high banks. They
      grunted &ldquo;How!&rdquo; in greeting, as the foremost canoe made for the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if surprise could have changed the countenances of Indians, these
      Athabascas would not have known one another when the missionary stepped
      out upon the shore. They had looked to see a grey-bearded man like the
      chief factor who quarrelled and prayed; but they found instead a
      round-faced, clean-shaven youth, with big, good-natured eyes, yellow hair,
      and a roundness of body like that of a month-old bear&rsquo;s cub. They expected
      to find a man who, like the factor, could speak their language, and they
      found a cherub sort of youth who talked only English, French, and Chinook&mdash;that
      common language of the North&mdash;and a few words of their own language
      which he had learned on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, Oshondonto was so absent-minded at the moment, so absorbed in
      admiration of the garish scene before him, that he addressed the chief in
      French, of which Knife-in-the-Wind knew but the one word cache, which all
      the North knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently William Rufus Holly recovered himself, and in stumbling
      Chinook made himself understood. Opening a bale, he brought out beads and
      tobacco and some bright red flannel, and two hundred Indians sat round him
      and grunted &ldquo;How!&rdquo; and received his gifts with little comment. Then the
      pipe of peace went round, and Oshondonto smoked it becomingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he saw that the Indians despised him for his youth, his fatness, his
      yellow hair as soft as a girl&rsquo;s, his cherub face, browned though it was by
      the sun and weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he handed the pipe to Knife-in-the-Wind, an Indian called Silver
      Tassel, with a cruel face, said grimly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does Oshondonto travel to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Rufus Holly&rsquo;s eyes steadied on those of the Indian as he replied
      in Chinook: &ldquo;To teach the way to Manitou the Mighty, to tell the
      Athabascas of the Great Chief who died to save the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story is told in many ways; which is right? There was the factor,
      Word of Thunder. There is the song they sing at Edmonton&mdash;I have
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Great Chief is the same Chief,&rdquo; answered the missionary. &ldquo;If you tell
      of Fort O&rsquo;Call, and Knife-in-the-Wind tells of Fort O&rsquo;Call, he and you
      will speak different words, and one will put in one thing and one will
      leave out another; men&rsquo;s tongues are different. But Fort O&rsquo;Call is
      the-same, and the Great Chief is the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a long time ago,&rdquo; said Knife-in-the-Wind sourly, &ldquo;many thousand
      moons, as the pebbles in the river, the years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same world, and it is the same Chief, and it was to save us,&rdquo;
       answered William Rufus Holly, smiling, yet with a fluttering heart, for
      the first test of his life had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In anger Knife-in-the-Wind thrust an arrow into the ground and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can the white man who died thousands of moons ago in a far country
      save the red man to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strong man should bear so weak a tale,&rdquo; broke in Silver Tassel
      ruthlessly. &ldquo;Are we children that the Great Chief sends a child as
      messenger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Billy Rufus did not know how to reply, and in the pause
      Knife-in-the-Wind broke in two pieces the arrow he had thrust in the
      ground in token of displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as Oshondonto was about to speak, Silver Tassel sprang to his
      feet, seized in his arms a lad of twelve who was standing near, and
      running to the bank, dropped him into the swift current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Oshondonto be not a child, let him save the lad,&rdquo; said Silver Tassel,
      standing on the brink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly William Rufus Holly was on his feet. His coat was off before
      Silver Tassel&rsquo;s words were out of his mouth, and crying, &ldquo;In the name of
      the Great White Chief!&rdquo; he jumped into the rushing current. &ldquo;In the name
      of your Manitou, come on, Silver Tassel!&rdquo; he called up from the water, and
      struck out for the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not pausing an instant, Silver Tassel sprang into the flood, into the
      whirling eddies and dangerous current below the first rapids and above the
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the struggle for Wingo of the Cree tribe, a waif among the
      Athabascas, whose father had been slain as they travelled, by a wandering
      tribe of Blackfeet. Never was there a braver rivalry, although the odds
      were with the Indian-in lightness, in brutal strength. With the mikonaree,
      however, were skill, and that sort of strength which the world calls
      &ldquo;moral,&rdquo; the strength of a good and desperate purpose. Oshondonto knew
      that on the issue of this shameless business&mdash;this cruel sport of
      Silver Tassel&mdash;would depend his future on the Peace River. As he shot
      forward with strong strokes in the whirling torrent after the helpless
      lad, who, only able to keep himself afloat, was being swept down towards
      the rapids below, he glanced up to the bank along which the Athabascas
      were running. He saw the garish colours of their dresses; he saw the
      ignorant medicine man, with his mysterious bag, making incantations; he
      saw the tepee of the chief, with its barbarous pennant above; he saw the
      idle, naked children tearing at the entrails of a calf; and he realised
      that this was a deadly tournament between civilisation and barbarism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver Tassel was gaining on him, they were both overhauling the boy; it
      was now to see which should reach Wingo first, which should take him to
      shore. That is, if both were not carried under before they reached him;
      that is, if, having reached him, they and he would ever get to shore; for,
      lower down, before it reached the rapids, the current ran horribly smooth
      and strong, and here and there were jagged rocks just beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Silver Tassel gained on him, as they both gained on the boy.
      Oshondonto swam strong and hard, but he swam with his eye on the struggle
      for the shore also; he was not putting forth his utmost strength, for he
      knew it would be bitterly needed, perhaps to save his own life by a last
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver Tassel passed him when they were about fifty feet from the boy.
      Shooting by on his side, with a long stroke and the plunge of his body
      like a projectile, the dark face with the long black hair plastering it
      turned towards his own, in fierce triumph Silver Tassel cried &ldquo;How!&rdquo; in
      derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Rufus set his teeth and lay down to his work like a sportsman. His
      face had lost its roses, and it was set and determined, but there was no
      look of fear upon it, nor did his heart sink when a cry of triumph went up
      from the crowd on the banks. The white man knew by old experience in the
      cricket-field and in many a boat-race that it is well not to halloo till
      you are out of the woods. His mettle was up, he was not the Reverend
      William Rufus Holly, missionary, but Billy Rufus, the champion cricketer,
      the sportsman playing a long game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver Tassel reached the boy, who was bruised and bleeding and at his
      last gasp, and throwing an arm round him, struck out for the shore. The
      current was very strong, and he battled fiercely as Billy Rufus, not far
      above, moved down toward them at an angle. For a few yards Silver Tassel
      was going strong, then his pace slackened, he seemed to sink lower in the
      water, and his stroke became splashing and irregular. Suddenly he struck a
      rock, which bruised him badly, and, swerving from his course, he lost his
      stroke and let go the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the mikonaree had swept beyond them, and he caught the boy by
      his long hair as he was being swept below. Striking out for the shore, he
      swam with bold, strong strokes, his judgment guiding him well past rocks
      beneath the surface. Ten feet from shore he heard a cry of alarm from
      above. It concerned Silver Tassel, he knew, but he could not look round
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment the boy was dragged up the bank by strong hands, and
      Billy Rufus swung round in the water towards Silver Tassel, who, in his
      confused energy, had struck another rock, and, exhausted now, was being
      swept towards the rapids. Silver Tassel&rsquo;s shoulder scarcely showed, his
      strength was gone. In a flash Billy Rufus saw there was but one thing to
      do. He must run the rapids with Silver Tassel-there was no other way. It
      would be a fight through the jaws of death; but no Indian&rsquo;s eyes had a
      better sense for river-life than William Rufus Holly&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he reached Silver Tassel, and drew the Indian&rsquo;s arm over his own
      shoulder; how they drove down into the boiling flood; how Billy Rufus&rsquo;s
      fat body was battered and torn and ran red with blood from twenty flesh
      wounds; but how by luck beyond the telling he brought Silver Tassel
      through safely into the quiet water a quarter of a mile below the rapids,
      and was hauled out, both more dead than alive, is a tale still told by the
      Athabascas around their camp-fire. The rapids are known to-day as the
      Mikonaree Rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of this beginning of the young man&rsquo;s career was that Silver Tassel
      gave him the word of eternal friendship, Knife-in-the-Wind took him into
      the tribe, and the boy Wingo became his very own, to share his home, and
      his travels, no longer a waif among the Athabascas.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three days&rsquo; feasting, at the end of which the missionary held his
      first service and preached his first sermon, to the accompaniment of
      grunts of satisfaction from the whole tribe of Athabascas, William Rufus
      Holly began his work in the Far North.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey to Fort O&rsquo;Call was a procession of triumph, for, as it was
      summer, there was plenty of food, the missionary had been a success, and
      he had distributed many gifts of beads and flannel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well for many moons, although converts were uncertain and
      baptisms few, and the work was hard and the loneliness at times terrible.
      But at last came dark days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer and autumn there had been poor fishing and shooting, the caches
      of meat were fewer on the plains, and almost nothing had come up to Fort
      O&rsquo;Call from Edmonton, far below. The yearly supplies for the missionary,
      paid for out of his private income&mdash;the bacon, beans, tea, coffee and
      flour&mdash;had been raided by a band of hostile Indians, and he viewed
      with deep concern the progress of the severe winter. Although three years
      of hard, frugal life had made his muscles like iron, they had only
      mellowed his temper, increased his flesh and rounded his face; nor did he
      look an hour older than on the day when he had won Wingo for his willing
      slave and devoted friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never resented the frequent ingratitude of the Indians; he said little
      when they quarrelled over the small comforts his little income brought
      them yearly from the South. He had been doctor, lawyer, judge among them,
      although he interfered little in the larger disputes, and was forced to
      shut his eyes to intertribal enmities. He had no deep faith that he could
      quite civilise them; he knew that their conversion was only on the
      surface, and he fell back on his personal influence with them. By this he
      could check even the excesses of the worst man in the tribe, his old
      enemy, Silver Tassel of the bad heart, who yet was ready always to give a
      tooth for a tooth, and accepted the fact that he owed Oshondonto his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When famine crawled across the plains to the doors of the settlement and
      housed itself at Fort O&rsquo;Call, Silver Tassel acted badly, however, and
      sowed fault-finding among the thoughtless of the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What manner of Great Spirit is it who lets the food of his chief
      Oshondonto fall into the hands of the Blackfeet?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oshondonto
      says the Great Spirit hears. What has the Great Spirit to say? Let
      Oshondonto ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, when they all were hungrier, he went among them with complaining
      words. &ldquo;If the white man&rsquo;s Great Spirit can do all things, let him give
      Oshondonto and the Athabascas food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The missionary did not know of Silver Tassel&rsquo;s foolish words, but he saw
      the downcast face of Knife-in-the-Wind, the sullen looks of the people;
      and he unpacked the box he had reserved jealously for the darkest days
      that might come. For meal after meal he divided these delicacies among
      them&mdash;morsels of biscuit, and tinned meats, and dried fruits. But his
      eyes meanwhile were turned again and again to the storm raging without, as
      it had raged for this the longest week he had ever spent. If it would but
      slacken, a boat could go out to the nets set in the lake near by some days
      before, when the sun of spring had melted the ice. From the hour the nets
      had been set the storm had raged. On the day when the last morsel of meat
      and biscuit had been given away the storm had not abated, and he saw with
      misgiving the gloomy, stolid faces of the Indians round him. One man, two
      children, and three women had died in a fortnight. He dreaded to think
      what might happen, his heart ached at the looks of gaunt suffering in the
      faces of all; he saw, for the first time, how black and bitter
      Knife-in-the-Wind looked as Silver Tassel whispered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the colour all gone from his cheeks, he left the post and made his
      way to the edge of the lake where his canoe was kept. Making it ready for
      the launch, he came back to the Fort. Assembling the Indians, who had
      watched his movements closely, he told them that he was going through the
      storm to the nets on the lake, and asked for a volunteer to go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one replied. He pleaded-for the sake of the women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Knife-in-the-Wind spoke. &ldquo;Oshondonto will die if he goes. It is a
      fool&rsquo;s journey&mdash;does the wolverine walk into an empty trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy Rufus spoke passionately now. His genial spirit fled; he reproached
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver Tassel spoke up loudly. &ldquo;Let Oshondonto&rsquo;s Great Spirit carry him to
      the nets alone, and back again with fish for the heathen the Great Chief
      died to save.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a wicked heart, Silver Tassel. You know well that one man can&rsquo;t
      handle the boat and the nets also. Is there no one of you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A figure shot forwards from a corner. &ldquo;I will go with Oshondonto,&rdquo; came
      the voice of Wingo, the waif of the Crees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye of the mikonaree flashed round in contempt on the tribe. Then
      suddenly it softened, and he said to the lad: &ldquo;We will go together,
      Wingo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking the boy by the hand, he ran with him through the rough wind to the
      shore, launched the canoe on the tossing lake, and paddled away through
      the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitter winds of an angry spring, the sleet and wet snow of a belated
      winter, the floating blocks of ice crushing against the side of the boat,
      the black water swishing over man and boy, the harsh, inclement world near
      and far.... The passage made at last to the nets; the brave Wingo
      steadying the canoe&mdash;a skilful hand sufficing where the strength of a
      Samson would not have availed; the nets half full, and the breaking cry of
      joy from the lips of the waif-a cry that pierced the storm and brought
      back an answering cry from the crowd of Indians on the far shore... The
      quarter-hour of danger in the tossing canoe; the nets too heavy to be
      dragged, and fastened to the thwarts instead; the canoe going shoreward
      jerkily, a cork on the waves with an anchor behind; heavier seas and winds
      roaring down on them as they slowly near the shore; and at last, in one
      awful moment, the canoe upset, and the man and the boy in the water. ...
      Then both clinging to the upturned canoe as it is driven nearer and nearer
      shore.... The boy washed off once, twice, and the man with his arm round
      clinging-clinging, as the shrieking storm answers to the calling of the
      Athabascas on the shore, and drives craft and fish and man and boy down
      upon the banks; no savage bold enough to plunge in to their rescue. ... At
      last a rope thrown, a drowning man&rsquo;s wrists wound round it, his teeth set
      in it&mdash;and now, at last, a man and a heathen boy, both insensible,
      being carried to the mikonaree&rsquo;s but and laid upon two beds, one on either
      side of the small room, as the red sun goes slowly down. ... The two still
      bodies on bearskins in the hut, and a hundred superstitious Indians flying
      from the face of death.... The two alone in the light of the flickering
      fire; the many gone to feast on fish, the price of lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the price was not yet paid, for the man waked from insensibility&mdash;waked
      to see himself with the body of the boy beside him in the red light of the
      fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his heart stopped beating, he turned sick and faint. Deserted
      by those for whom he risked his life!... How long had he lain there? What
      time was it? When was it that he had fought his way to the nets and back
      again-hours maybe? And the dead boy there, Wingo, who had risked his life,
      also dead&mdash;how long? His heart leaped&mdash;ah! not hours, only
      minutes maybe. It was sundown as unconsciousness came on him&mdash;Indians
      would not stay with the dead after sundown. Maybe it was only ten
      minutes-five minutes&mdash;one minute ago since they left him!...
    </p>
    <p>
      His watch! Shaking fingers drew it out, wild eyes scanned it. It was not
      stopped. Then it could have only been minutes ago. Trembling to his feet,
      he staggered over to Wingo, he felt the body, he held a mirror to the
      lips. Yes, surely there was light moisture on the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began another fight with death&mdash;William Rufus Holly struggling
      to bring to life again Wingo, the waif of the Crees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood came back to his own heart with a rush as the mad desire to save
      this life came on him. He talked to the dumb face, he prayed in a kind of
      delirium, as he moved the arms up and down, as he tilted the body, as he
      rubbed, chafed and strove. He forgot he was a missionary, he almost cursed
      himself. &ldquo;For them&mdash;for cowards, I risked his life, the brave lad
      with no home. Oh, God! give him back to me!&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;What right had I
      to risk his life for theirs? I should have shot the first man that refused
      to go.... Wingo, speak! Wake up! Come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sweat poured from him in his desperation and weakness. He said to
      himself that he had put this young life into the hazard without cause. Had
      he, then, saved the lad from the rapids and Silver Tassel&rsquo;s brutality only
      to have him drag fish out of the jaws of death for Silver Tassel&rsquo;s meal?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that he had been working for hours, though it was in fact
      only a short time, when the eyes of the lad slowly opened and closed
      again, and he began to breathe spasmodically. A cry of joy came from the
      lips of the missionary, and he worked harder still. At last the eyes
      opened wide, stayed open, saw the figure bent over him, and the lips
      whispered, &ldquo;Oshondonto&mdash;my master,&rdquo; as a cup of brandy was held to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had conquered the Athabascas for ever. Even Silver Tassel acknowledged
      his power, and he as industriously spread abroad the report that the
      mikonaree had raised Wingo from the dead, as he had sown dissension during
      the famine. But the result was that the missionary had power in the land,
      and the belief in him was so great, that, when Knife-in-the-Wind died, the
      tribe came to ask him to raise their chief from the dead. They never quite
      believed that he could not&mdash;not even Silver Tassel, who now rules the
      Athabascas and is ruled by William Rufus Holly: which is a very good thing
      for the Athabascas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Rufus the cricketer had won the game, and somehow the Reverend
      William Rufus Holly the missionary never repented the strong language he
      used against the Athabascas, as he was bringing Wingo back to life, though
      it was not what is called &ldquo;strictly canonical.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE HEALING SPRINGS AND THE PIONEERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      He came out of the mysterious South one summer day, driving before him a
      few sheep, a cow, and a long-eared mule which carried his tent and other
      necessaries, and camped outside the town on a knoll, at the base of which
      was a thicket of close shrub. During the first day no one in Jansen
      thought anything of it, for it was a land of pilgrimage, and hundreds came
      and went on their journeys in search of free homesteads and good water and
      pasturage. But when, after three days, he was still there, Nicolle
      Terasse, who had little to do, and an insatiable curiosity, went out to
      see him. He found a new sensation for Jansen. This is what he said when he
      came back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want know &lsquo;bout him, bagosh! Dat is somet&rsquo;ing to see, dat man&mdash;Ingles
      is his name. Sooch hair&mdash;mooch long an&rsquo; brown, and a leetla beard not
      so brown, an&rsquo; a leather sole onto his feet, and a grey coat to his ankles&mdash;yes,
      so like dat. An&rsquo; his voice&mdash;voila, it is like water in a cave. He is
      a great man&mdash;I dunno not; but he spik at me like dis, &lsquo;Is dere sick,
      and cripple, and stay in-bed people here dat can&rsquo;t get up?&rsquo; he say. An&rsquo; I
      say, &lsquo;Not plenty, but some-bagosh! Dere is dat Miss Greet, an&rsquo; ole Ma&rsquo;am
      Drouchy, an&rsquo; dat young Pete Hayes&mdash;an&rsquo; so on.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, if they have
      faith I will heal them,&rsquo; he spik at me. &lsquo;From de Healing Springs dey shall
      rise to walk,&rsquo; he say. Bagosh, you not t&rsquo;ink dat true? Den you go see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Jansen turned out to see, and besides the man they found a curious
      thing. At the foot of the knoll, in a space which he had cleared, was a
      hot spring that bubbled and rose and sank, and drained away into the
      thirsty ground. Luck had been with Ingles the Faith Healer. Whether he
      knew of the existence of this spring, or whether he chanced upon it, he
      did not say; but while he held Jansen in the palm of his hand, in the
      feverish days that followed, there were many who attached mysterious
      significance to it, who claimed for it supernatural origin. In any case,
      the one man who had known of the existence of this spring was far away
      from Jansen, and he did not return till a day of reckoning came for the
      Faith Healer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Jansen made pilgrimage to the Springs of Healing, and at
      unexpected times Ingles suddenly appeared in the town, and stood at street
      corners; and in his &ldquo;Patmian voice,&rdquo; as Flood Rawley the lawyer called it,
      warned the people to flee their sins, and purifying their hearts, learn to
      cure all ills of mind and body, the weaknesses of the sinful flesh and the
      &ldquo;ancient evil&rdquo; in their souls, by faith that saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is not the life more than meat&rsquo;&rdquo; he asked them. &ldquo;And if, peradventure,
      there be those among you who have true belief in hearts all purged of
      evil, and yet are maimed, or sick of body, come to me, and I will lay my
      hands upon you, and I will heal you.&rdquo; Thus he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those so wrought upon by his strange eloquence and spiritual
      passion, so hypnotised by his physical and mental exaltation, that they
      rose up from the hand-laying and the prayer eased of their ailments.
      Others he called upon to lie in the hot spring at the foot of the hill for
      varying periods, before the laying on of hands, and these also, crippled,
      or rigid with troubles&rsquo; of the bone, announced that they were healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      People flocked from other towns, and though, to some who had been cured,
      their pains and sickness returned, there were a few who bore perfect
      evidence to his teaching and healing, and followed him, &ldquo;converted and
      consecrated,&rdquo; as though he were a new Messiah. In this corner of the West
      was such a revival as none could remember&mdash;not even those who had
      been to camp meetings in the East in their youth, and had seen the Spirit
      descend upon hundreds and draw them to the anxious seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the great sensation&mdash;the Faith Healer converted Laura
      Sloly. Upon which Jansen drew its breath painfully; for, while it was
      willing to bend to the inspiration of the moment, and to be swept on a
      tide of excitement into that enchanted field called Imagination, it wanted
      to preserve its institutions&mdash;and Laura Sloly had come to be an
      institution. Jansen had always plumed itself, and smiled, when she passed;
      and even now the most sentimentally religious of them inwardly anticipated
      the time when the town would return to its normal condition; and that
      condition would not be normal if there were any change in Laura Sloly. It
      mattered little whether most people were changed or not because one state
      of their minds could not be less or more interesting than another; but a
      change in Laura. Sloly could not be for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had come to the West in the early days, and had prospered by
      degrees until a town grew up beside his ranch; and though he did not
      acquire as much permanent wealth from this golden chance as might have
      been expected, and lost much he did make by speculation, still he had his
      rich ranch left, and it, and he, and Laura were part of the history of
      Jansen. Laura had been born at Jansen before even it had a name. Next to
      her father she was the oldest inhabitant, and she had a prestige which was
      given to no one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything had conspired to make her a figure of moment and interest. She
      was handsome in almost a mannish sort of way, being of such height and
      straightness, and her brown eyes had a depth and fire in which more than a
      few men had drowned themselves. Also, once she had saved a settlement by
      riding ahead of a marauding Indian band to warn their intended victims,
      and had averted another tragedy of pioneer life. Pioneers proudly told
      strangers to Jansen of the girl of thirteen who rode a hundred and twenty
      miles without food, and sank inside the palisade of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
      Company&rsquo;s fort, as the gates closed upon the settlers taking refuge, the
      victim of brain fever at last. Cerebrospinal meningitis, the doctor from
      Winnipeg called it, and the memory of that time when men and women would
      not sleep till her crisis was past, was still fresh on the tongues of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she had married at seventeen, and, within a year, had lost both her
      husband and her baby, a child bereaved of her Playmates&mdash;for her
      husband had been but twenty years old and was younger far than she in
      everything. And since then, twelve years before, she had seen generations
      of lovers pass into the land they thought delectable; and their children
      flocked to her, hung about her, were carried off by her to the ranch, and
      kept for days, against the laughing protests of their parents. Flood
      Rawley called her the Pied Piper of Jansen, and indeed she had a voice
      that fluted and piped, and yet had so whimsical a note, that the hardest
      faces softened at the sound of it; and she did not keep its best notes for
      the few. She was impartial, almost impersonal; no woman was her enemy, and
      every man was her friend&mdash;and nothing more. She had never had an
      accepted lover since the day her Playmates left her. Every man except one
      had given up hope that he might win her; and though he had been gone from
      Jansen for two years, and had loved her since the days before the
      Playmates came and went, he never gave up hope, and was now to return and
      say again what he had mutely said for years&mdash;what she understood, and
      he knew she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim Denton had been a wild sort in his brief day. He was a rough diamond,
      but he was a diamond, and was typical of the West&mdash;its heart, its
      courage, its freedom, and its force; capable of exquisite gentleness,
      strenuous to exaggeration, with a very primitive religion; and the only
      religion Tim knew was that of human nature. Jansen did not think Tim good
      enough&mdash;not within a comet shot&mdash;for Laura Sloly; but they
      thought him better than any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Laura was a convert to the prophet of the Healing Springs, and
      those people who still retain their heads in the eddy of religious emotion
      were in despair. They dreaded to meet Laura; they kept away from the
      &ldquo;protracted meetings,&rdquo; but were eager to hear about her and what she said
      and did. What they heard allayed their worst fears. She still smiled, and
      seemed as cheerful as before, they heard, and she neither spoke nor prayed
      in public, but she led the singing always. Now the anxious and the
      sceptical and the reactionary ventured out to see and hear; and seeing and
      hearing gave them a satisfaction they hardly dared express. She was more
      handsome than ever, and if her eyes glistened with a light they had never
      seen before, and awed them, her lips still smiled, and the old laugh came
      when she spoke to them. Their awe increased. This was &ldquo;getting religion&rdquo;
       with a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently they received a shock. A whisper grew that Laura was in love
      with the Faith Healer. Some woman&rsquo;s instinct drove straight to the centre
      of a disconcerting possibility, and in consternation she told her husband;
      and Jansen husbands had a freemasonry of gossip. An hour, and all Jansen
      knew, or thought they knew; and the &ldquo;saved&rdquo; rejoiced; and the rest of the
      population, represented by Nicolle Terasse at one end and Flood Rawley at
      the other, flew to arms. No vigilance committee was ever more determined
      and secret and organised than the unconverted civic patriots, who were
      determined to restore Jansen to its old-time condition. They pointed out
      cold-bloodedly that the Faith Healer had failed three times where he had
      succeeded once; and that, admitting the successes, there was no proof that
      his religion was their cause. There were such things as hypnotism and
      magnetism and will-power, and abnormal mental stimulus on the part of the
      healed&mdash;to say nothing of the Healing Springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carefully laying their plans, they quietly spread the rumour that Ingles
      had promised to restore to health old Mary Jewell, who had been bedridden
      ten years, and had sent word and prayed to have him lay his hands upon her&mdash;Catholic
      though she was. The Faith Healer, face to face with this supreme and
      definite test, would have retreated from it but for Laura Sloly. She
      expected him to do it, believed that he could, said that he would, herself
      arranged the day and the hour, and sang so much exaltation into him, that
      at last a spurious power seemed to possess him. He felt that there had
      entered into him something that could be depended on, not the mere flow of
      natural magnetism fed by an outdoor life and a temperament of great
      emotional force, and chance, and suggestion&mdash;and other things. If, at
      first, he had influenced Laura, some ill-controlled, latent idealism in
      him, working on a latent poetry and spirituality in her, somehow bringing
      her into nearer touch with her lost Playmates than she had been in the
      long years that had passed; she, in turn, had made his unrationalised
      brain reel; had caught him up into a higher air, on no wings of his own;
      had added another lover to her company of lovers&mdash;and the first
      impostor she had ever had. She who had known only honest men as friends,
      in one blind moment lost her perspicuous sense; her instinct seemed
      asleep. She believed in the man and in his healing. Was there anything
      more than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of the great test came, hot, brilliant, vivid. The air was of a
      delicate sharpness, and, as it came toward evening, the glamour of an
      August when the reapers reap was upon Jansen; and its people gathered
      round the house of Mary Jewell to await the miracle of faith. Apart from
      the emotional many who sang hymns and spiritual songs were a few
      determined men, bent on doing justice to Jansen though the heavens might
      fall. Whether or no Laura Sloly was in love with the Faith Healer, Jansen
      must look to its own honour&mdash;and hers. In any case, this peripatetic
      saint at Sloly&rsquo;s Ranch&mdash;the idea was intolerable; women must be saved
      in spite of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was now in the house by the side of the bedridden Mary Jewell,
      waiting, confident, smiling, as she held the wasted hand on the coverlet.
      With her was a minister of the Baptist persuasion, who was swimming with
      the tide, and who approved of the Faith Healer&rsquo;s immersions in the hot
      Healing Springs; also a medical student who had pretended belief in
      Ingles, and two women weeping with unnecessary remorse for human failings
      of no dire kind. The windows were open, and those outside could see.
      Presently, in a lull of the singing, there was a stir in the crowd, and
      then, sudden loud greetings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, if it ain&rsquo;t Tim Denton! Jerusalem! You back, Tim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These and other phrases caught the ear of Laura Sloly in the sick-room. A
      strange look flashed across her face, and the depth of her eyes was
      troubled for a moment, as to the face of the old comes a tremor at the
      note of some long-forgotten song. Then she steadied herself and waited,
      catching bits of the loud talk which still floated towards her from
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? Some one getting married&mdash;or a legacy, or a saw-off? Why,
      what a lot of Sunday-go-to-meeting folks to be sure!&rdquo; Tim laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which the quick tongue of Nicolle Terasse: &ldquo;You want know? Tiens, be
      quiet; here he come. He cure you body and soul, ver&rsquo; queeck&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd swayed and parted, and slowly, bare head uplifted, face looking
      to neither right nor left, the Faith Healer made his way to the door of
      the little house. The crowd hushed. Some were awed, some were
      overpoweringly interested, some were cruelly patient. Nicolle Terasse and
      others were whispering loudly to Tim Denton. That was the only sound,
      until the Healer got to the door. Then, on the steps, he turned to the
      multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace be to you all, and upon this house,&rdquo; he said and stepped through
      the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim Denton, who had been staring at the face of the Healer, stood for an
      instant like one with all his senses arrested. Then he gasped, and
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m eternally&mdash;&rdquo; and broke off with a low laugh,
      which was at first mirthful, and then became ominous and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, magnificent&mdash;magnificent&mdash;jerickety!&rdquo; he said into the sky
      above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends who were not &ldquo;saved,&rdquo; closed in on him to find the meaning of
      his words, but he pulled himself together, looked blankly at them, and
      asked them questions. They told him so much more than he cared to hear,
      that his face flushed a deep red&mdash;the bronze of it most like the
      colour of Laura Sloly&rsquo;s hair; then he turned pale. Men saw that he was
      roused beyond any feeling in themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he can do.&rdquo; With the many who were
      silently praying, as they had been, bidden to do, the invincible ones
      leant forwards, watching the little room where healing&mdash;or tragedy&mdash;was
      afoot. As in a picture, framed by the window, they saw the kneeling
      figures, the Healer standing with outstretched arms. They heard his voice,
      sonorous and appealing, then commanding&mdash;and yet Mary Jewell did not
      rise from her bed and walk. Again, and yet again, the voice rang out, and
      still the woman lay motionless. Then he laid his hands upon her, and again
      he commanded her to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint movement, a desperate struggle to obey, but Nature and
      Time and Disease had their way. Yet again there was the call. An agony
      stirred the bed. Then another great Healer came between, and mercifully
      dealt the sufferer a blow&mdash;Death has a gentle hand sometimes. Mary
      Jewell was bedridden still&mdash;and for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a wind from the mountains the chill knowledge of death wailed through
      the window, and over the heads of the crowd. All the figures were upright
      now in the little room. Then those outside saw Laura Sloly lean over and
      close the sightless eyes. This done, she came to the door and opened it,
      and motioned for the Healer to leave. He hesitated, hearing the harsh
      murmur from the outskirts of the crowd. Once again she motioned, and he
      came. With a face deadly pale she surveyed the people before her silently
      for a moment, her eyes all huge and staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she turned to Ingles and spoke to him quickly in a low voice;
      then, descending the steps, passed out through the lane made for her by
      the crowd, he following with shaking limbs and bowed bead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warning words had passed among the few invincible ones who waited where
      the Healer must pass into the open, and there was absolute stillness as
      Laura advanced. Their work was to come&mdash;quiet and swift and sure; but
      not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one face Laura saw, as she led the way to the moment&rsquo;s safety&mdash;Tim
      Denton&rsquo;s; and it was as stricken as her own. She passed, then turned, and
      looked at him again. He understood; she wanted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till she sprang into her waggon, after the Healer had mounted
      his mule and ridden away with ever-quickening pace into the prairie. Then
      he turned to the set, fierce men beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;leave him to me. I know him. You hear? Ain&rsquo;t
      I no rights? I tell you I knew him&mdash;South. You leave him to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They nodded, and he sprang into his saddle and rode away. They watched the
      figure of the Healer growing smaller in the dusty distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim&rsquo;ll go to her,&rdquo; one said, &ldquo;and perhaps they&rsquo;ll let the snake get off.
      Hadn&rsquo;t we best make sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better let him vamoose,&rdquo; said Flood Rawley anxiously.
      &ldquo;Jansen is a law-abiding place!&rdquo; The reply was decisive. Jansen had its
      honour to keep. It was the home of the Pioneers&mdash;Laura Sloly was a
      Pioneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim Denton was a Pioneer, with all the comradeship which lay in the word,
      and he was that sort of lover who has seen one woman, and can never see
      another&mdash;not the product of the most modern civilisation. Before
      Laura had had Playmates he had given all he had to give; he had waited and
      hoped ever since; and when the ruthless gossips had said to him before
      Mary Jewell&rsquo;s house that she was in love with the Faith Healer, nothing
      changed in him. For the man, for Ingles, Tim belonged to a primitive
      breed, and love was not in his heart. As he rode out to Sloly&rsquo;s Ranch, he
      ground his teeth in rage. But Laura had called him to her, and: &ldquo;Well,
      what you say goes, Laura,&rdquo; he muttered at the end of a long hour of human
      passion and its repression. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s to go scot-free, then he&rsquo;s got to go;
      but the boys yonder&rsquo;ll drop on me, if he gets away. Can&rsquo;t you see what a
      swab he is, Laura?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brown eyes of the girl looked at him gently. The struggle between them
      was over; she had had her way&mdash;to save the preacher, impostor though
      he was; and now she felt, as she had never felt before in the same
      fashion, that this man was a man of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim, you do not understand,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;You say he was a landsharp in
      the South, and that he had to leave-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had to vamoose, or take tar and feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he had to leave. And he came here preaching and healing; and he is a
      hypocrite and a fraud&mdash;I know that now, my eyes are opened. He didn&rsquo;t
      do what he said he could do, and it killed Mary Jewell&mdash;the shock;
      and there were other things he said he could do, and he didn&rsquo;t do them.
      Perhaps he is all bad, as you say&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so. But he did some
      good things, and through him I&rsquo;ve felt as I&rsquo;ve never felt before about God
      and life, and about Walt and the baby&mdash;as though I&rsquo;ll see them again,
      sure. I&rsquo;ve never felt that before. It was all as if they were lost in the
      hills, and no trail home, or out to where they are. Like as not God was
      working in him all the time, Tim; and he failed because he counted too
      much on the little he had, and made up for what he hadn&rsquo;t by what he
      pretended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can pretend to himself, or God Almighty, or that lot down there&rdquo;&mdash;he
      jerked a finger towards the town&mdash;&ldquo;but to you, a girl, and a Pioneer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flash of humour shot into her eyes at his last words, then they filled
      with tears, through which the smile shone. To pretend to &ldquo;a Pioneer&rdquo;&mdash;the
      splendid vanity and egotism of the West!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t pretend to me, Tim. People don&rsquo;t usually have to pretend to
      like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m driving at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. And whatever he is, you&rsquo;ve said that you will save him.
      I&rsquo;m straight, you know that. Somehow, what I felt from his preaching&mdash;well,
      everything got sort of mixed up with him, and he was&mdash;was different.
      It was like the long dream of Walt and the baby, and he a part of it. I
      don&rsquo;t know what I felt, or what I might have felt for him. I&rsquo;m a woman&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t understand. But I know what I feel now. I never want to see him
      again on earth&mdash;or in Heaven. It needn&rsquo;t be necessary even in Heaven;
      but what happened between God and me through him stays, Tim; and so you
      must help him get away safe. It&rsquo;s in your hands&mdash;you say they left it
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust that too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he pointed out of the window towards the town. &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;m right;
      there they are, a dozen of &lsquo;em mounted. They&rsquo;re off, to run him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face paled; she glanced towards the Hill of Healing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got an
      hour&rsquo;s start,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll get into the mountains and be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t catch him &lsquo;fore that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or if you don&rsquo;t get to him first,&rdquo; she said, with nervous insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her with a hard look; then, as he met her soft, fearless,
      beautiful eyes, his own grew gentle. &ldquo;It takes a lot of doing. Yet I&rsquo;ll do
      it for you, Laura,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard on the Pioneers.&rdquo; Once more
      her humour flashed, and it seemed to him that &ldquo;getting religion&rdquo; was not
      so depressing after all&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t be, anyhow, when this nasty job was
      over. &ldquo;The Pioneers will get over it, Tim,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      swallowed a lot in their time. Heaven&rsquo;s gate will have to be pretty wide
      to let in a real Pioneer,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;He takes up so much room&mdash;ah,
      Timothy Denton!&rdquo; she added, with an outburst of whimsical merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t spoiled you&mdash;being converted, has it?&rdquo; he said, and gave a
      quick little laugh, which somehow did more for his ancient cause with her
      than all he had ever said or done. Then he stepped outside and swung into
      his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a hard and anxious ride, but Tim had won, and was keeping his
      promise. The night had fallen before he got to the mountains, which he and
      the Pioneers had seen the Faith Healer enter. They had had four miles&rsquo; 
      start of Tim, and had ridden fiercely, and they entered the gulch into
      which the refugee had disappeared still two miles ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invincibles had seen Tim coming, but they had determined to make a
      sure thing of it, and would themselves do what was necessary with the
      impostor, and take no chances. So they pressed their horses, and he saw
      them swallowed by the trees, as darkness gathered. Changing his course, he
      entered the familiar hills, which he knew better than any pioneer of
      Jansen, and rode a diagonal course over the trail they would take. But
      night fell suddenly, and there was nothing to do but to wait till morning.
      There was comfort in this&mdash;the others must also wait, and the refugee
      could not go far. In any case, he must make for settlement or perish,
      since he had left behind his sheep and his cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell out better than Tim hoped. The Pioneers were as good hunters as
      was he, their instinct was as sure, their scouts and trackers were many,
      and he was but one. They found the Faith Healer by a little stream, eating
      bread and honey, and, like an ancient woodlander drinking from a horn&mdash;relics
      of his rank imposture. He made no resistance. They tried him formally, if
      perfunctorily; he admitted his imposture, and begged for his life. Then
      they stripped him naked, tied a bit of canvas round his waist, fastened
      him to a tree, and were about to complete his punishment when Tim Denton
      burst upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the rage Tim showed was all real or not; whether his accusations
      of bad faith came from so deeply wounded a spirit as he would have them
      believe, he was not likely to tell; but he claimed the prisoner as his
      own, and declined to say what he meant to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, they saw the abject terror of the Faith Healer as he begged
      not to be left alone with Tim&mdash;for they had not meant death, and
      Ingles thought he read death in Tim&rsquo;s ferocious eyes&mdash;they laughed
      cynically, and left it to Tim to uphold the honour of Jansen and the
      Pioneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they disappeared, the last thing they saw was Tim with his back to
      them, his hands on his hips, and a knife clasped in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll lift his scalp and make a monk of him,&rdquo; chuckled the oldest and
      hardest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat Tim will cut his heart out, I t&rsquo;ink-bagosh!&rdquo; said Nicolle Terasse,
      and took a drink of white-whiskey. For a long time Tim stood looking at
      the other, until no sound came from the woods, whither the Pioneers had
      gone. Then at last, slowly, and with no roughness, as the terror-stricken
      impostor shrank and withered, he cut the cords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress yourself,&rdquo; he said shortly, and sat down beside the stream, and
      washed his face and hands, as though to cleanse them from contamination.
      He appeared to take no notice of the other, though his ears keenly noted
      every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impostor dressed nervously, yet slowly; he scarce comprehended
      anything, except that he was not in immediate danger. When he had
      finished, he stood looking at Tim, who was still seated on a log plunged
      in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed hours before Tim turned round, and now his face was quiet, if
      set and determined. He walked slowly over, and stood looking at his victim
      for some time without speaking. The other&rsquo;s eyes dropped, and a greyness
      stole over his features. This steely calm was even more frightening than
      the ferocity which had previously been in his captor&rsquo;s face. At length the
      tense silence was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the old game good enough? Was it played out? Why did you take to
      this? Why did you do it, Scranton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice quavered a little in reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Something sort of
      pushed me into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to start it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, then the husky reply came. &ldquo;I got a sickener
      last time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember, at Waywing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got into the desert, and had hard times&mdash;awful for a while. I
      hadn&rsquo;t enough to eat, and I didn&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;d die by hunger, or
      fever, or Indians&mdash;or snakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were seeing snakes!&rdquo; said Tim grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the kind you mean; I hadn&rsquo;t anything to drink&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you never did drink, I remember&mdash;just was crooked, and slopped
      over women. Well, about the snakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught them to eat, and they were poison-snakes often. And I wasn&rsquo;t
      quick at first to get them safe by the neck&mdash;they&rsquo;re quick, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim laughed inwardly. &ldquo;Getting your food by the sweat of your brow&mdash;and
      a snake in it, same as Adam! Well, was it in the desert you got your taste
      for honey, too, same as John the Baptist&mdash;that was his name, if I
      recomember?&rdquo; He looked at the tin of honey on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the desert, but when I got to the grass-country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were you in the desert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close to a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim&rsquo;s eyes opened wider. He saw that the man was speaking the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to thinking in the desert, and sort of willing things to come to
      pass, and mooning along, you, and the sky, and the vultures, and the hot
      hills, and the snakes, and the flowers&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There weren&rsquo;t any flowers till I got to the grass-country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cuss me, if you ain&rsquo;t simple for your kind! I know all about that.
      And when you got to the grass-country, you just picked up the honey, and
      the flowers, and a calf, and a lamb, and a mule here and there, &lsquo;without
      money and without price,&rsquo; and walked on&mdash;that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other shrank before the steel in the voice, and nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you kept thinking in the grass-country of what you&rsquo;d felt and said
      and done&mdash;and willed, in the desert, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to you in the desert, as if you&rsquo;d saved your own life a hundred
      times, as if you&rsquo;d just willed food and drink and safety to come; as if
      Providence had been at your elbow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like a dream, and it stayed with me. I had to think in the desert
      things I&rsquo;d never thought before,&rdquo; was the half-abstracted answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You felt good in the desert?&rdquo; The other hung his head in shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes you seem pretty small, doesn&rsquo;t it? You didn&rsquo;t stay long enough, I
      guess, to get what you were feeling for; you started in on the new racket
      too soon. You never got really possessed that you was a sinner. I expect
      that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about such things. I was loose brought up; but
      I&rsquo;ve a friend&rdquo;&mdash;Laura was before his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;that says religion&rsquo;s
      all right, and long ago as I can remember my mother used to pray three
      times a day&mdash;with grace at meals, too. I know there&rsquo;s a lot in it for
      them that need it; and there seems to be a lot of folks needing it, if I&rsquo;m
      to judge by folks down there at Jansen, specially when there&rsquo;s the
      laying-on of hands and the Healing Springs. Oh, that was a pigsty game,
      Scranton, that about God giving you the Healing Springs, like Moses and
      the rock! Why, I discovered them springs myself two years ago, before I
      went South, and I guess God wasn&rsquo;t helping me any&mdash;not after I&rsquo;ve
      kept out of His way as I have. But, anyhow, religion&rsquo;s real; that&rsquo;s my
      sense of it; and you can get it, I bet, if you try. I&rsquo;ve seen it got. A
      friend of mine got it&mdash;got it under your preaching; not from you; but
      you was the accident that brought it about, I expect. It&rsquo;s funny&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      merakilous, but it&rsquo;s so. Kneel down!&rdquo; he added, with peremptory
      suddenness. &ldquo;Kneel, Scranton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fear the other knelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get religion now&mdash;here. You&rsquo;re going to pray for
      what you didn&rsquo;t get&mdash;and almost got&mdash;in the desert. You&rsquo;re going
      to ask forgiveness for all your damn tricks, and pray like a fanning-mill
      for the spirit to come down. You ain&rsquo;t a scoundrel at heart&mdash;a friend
      of mine says so. You&rsquo;re a weak vessel, cracked, perhaps. You&rsquo;ve got to be
      saved, and start right over again&mdash;and &lsquo;Praise God from whom all
      blessings flow!&rsquo; Pray&mdash;pray, Scranton, and tell the whole truth, and
      get it&mdash;get religion. Pray like blazes. You go on, and pray out loud.
      Remember the desert, and Mary Jewell, and your mother&mdash;did you have a
      mother, Scranton&mdash;say, did you have a mother, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim&rsquo;s voice suddenly lowered before the last word, for the Faith Healer
      had broken down in a torrent of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my mother&mdash;O God!&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s right&mdash;go on,&rdquo; said the other, and
      drew back a little, and sat down on a log. The man on his knees was
      convulsed with misery. Denton, the world, disappeared. He prayed in agony.
      Presently Tim moved uneasily, then got up and walked about; and at last,
      with a strange, awed look, when an hour was past, he stole back into the
      shadow of the trees, while still the wounded soul poured out its misery
      and repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time moved on. A curious shyness possessed Tim now, a thing which he had
      never felt in his life. He moved about self-consciously, awkwardly, until
      at last there was a sudden silence over by the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim looked, and saw the face of the kneeling man cleared, and quiet and
      shining. He hesitated, then stepped out, and came over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got it?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s noon now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God help me to redeem my past,&rdquo; answered the other in a new voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;sure?&rdquo; Tim&rsquo;s voice was meditative. &ldquo;God has spoken to
      me,&rdquo; was the simple answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a friend&rsquo;ll be glad to hear that,&rdquo;
       he said; and once more, in imagination, he saw Laura Sloly standing at the
      door of her home, with a light in her eyes he had never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want some money for your journey?&rdquo; Tim asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want nothing but to go away&mdash;far away,&rdquo; was the low reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve lived in the desert&mdash;I guess you can live in the
      grass-country,&rdquo; came the dry response. &ldquo;Good-bye-and good luck, Scranton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim turned to go, moved on a few steps, then looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;they&rsquo;ll not follow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it for you
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man appeared not to hear; he was still on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim faced the woods once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to mount his horse when he heard a step behind him. He turned
      sharply&mdash;and faced Laura. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t rest. I came out this morning.
      I&rsquo;ve seen everything,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t trust me,&rdquo; he said heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did anything else,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed half-fearfully into her eyes. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my
      best, as I said I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim,&rdquo; she said, and slipped a hand in his, &ldquo;would you mind the religion&mdash;if
      you had me?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE LITTLE WIDOW OF JANSEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her advent to Jansen was propitious. Smallpox in its most virulent form
      had broken out in the French-Canadian portion of the town, and, coming
      with some professional nurses from the East, herself an amateur, to attend
      the sufferers, she worked with such skill and devotion that the official
      thanks of the Corporation were offered her, together with a tiny gold
      watch, the gift of grateful citizens. But she still remained on at Jansen,
      saying always, however, that she was &ldquo;going East in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five years had passed, and still she had not gone East, but remained
      perched in the rooms she had first taken, over the Imperial Bank, while
      the town grew up swiftly round her. And even when the young bank manager
      married, and wished to take over the rooms, she sent him to the
      right-about from his own premises in her gay, masterful way. The young
      manager behaved well in the circumstances, because he had asked her to
      marry him, and she had dismissed him with a warning against challenging
      his own happiness&mdash;that was the way she had put it. Perhaps he was
      galled the less because others had striven for the same prize, and had
      been thrust back, with an almost tender misgiving as to their sense of
      self-preservation and sanity. Some of them were eligible enough, and all
      were of some position in the West. Yet she smiled them firmly away, to the
      wonder of Jansen, and to its satisfaction, for was it not a tribute to all
      that she would distinguish no particular unit by her permanent favour? But
      for one so sprightly and almost frivolous in manner at times, the
      self-denial seemed incongruous. She was unconventional enough to sit on
      the side-walk with a half-dozen children round her blowing bubbles, or to
      romp in any garden, or in the street, playing Puss-in-the-ring; yet this
      only made her more popular. Jansen&rsquo;s admiration was at its highest,
      however, when she rode in the annual steeplechase with the best horsemen
      of the province. She had the gift of doing as well as of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the light heart she has, and slippin&rsquo; in and out of things like a
      humming-bird, no easier to ketch, and no longer to stay,&rdquo; said Finden, the
      rich Irish landbroker, suggestively to Father Bourassa, the huge
      French-Canadian priest who had worked with her through all the dark weeks
      of the smallpox epidemic, and who knew what lay beneath the outer gaiety.
      She had been buoyant of spirit beside the beds of the sick, and her words
      were full of raillery and humour, yet there was ever a gentle note behind
      all; and the priest had seen her eyes shining with tears, as she bent over
      some stricken sufferer bound upon an interminable journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad! as bright a little spark as ever struck off the steel,&rdquo; added
      Finden to the priest, with a sidelong, inquisitive look, &ldquo;but a heart no
      bigger than a marrowfat pea-selfishness, all self. Keepin&rsquo; herself for
      herself when there&rsquo;s manny a good man needin&rsquo; her. Mother o&rsquo; Moses, how
      manny! From Terry O&rsquo;Ryan, brother of a peer, at Latouche, to Bernard
      Bapty, son of a millionaire, at Vancouver, there&rsquo;s a string o&rsquo; them. All
      pride and self; and as fair a lot they&rsquo;ve been as ever entered for the
      Marriage Cup. Now, isn&rsquo;t that so, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden&rsquo;s brogue did not come from a plebeian origin. It was part of his
      commercial equipment, an asset of his boyhood spent among the peasants on
      the family estate in Galway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Bourassa fanned himself with the black broadbrim hat he wore, and
      looked benignly but quizzically on the wiry, sharp-faced Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You t&rsquo;ink her heart is leetla. But perhaps it is your mind not so big
      enough to see&mdash;hein?&rdquo; The priest laughed noiselessly, showing white
      teeth. &ldquo;Was it so selfish in Madame to refuse the name of Finden&mdash;n&rsquo;est-ce
      pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden flushed, then burst into a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten I was one
      of them&mdash;the first almost. Blessed be he that expects nothing, for
      he&rsquo;ll get it, sure. It was my duty, and I did it. Was she to feel that
      Jansen did not price her high? Bedad, father, I rose betimes and did it,
      before anny man should say he set me the lead. Before the carpet in the
      parlour was down, and with the bare boards soundin&rsquo; to my words, I offered
      her the name of Finden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;the first of the long line! Bien, it is an honour.&rdquo; The
      priest paused a moment, looked at Finden with a curious reflective look,
      and then said: &ldquo;And so you t&rsquo;ink there is no one; that she will say yes
      not at all&mdash;no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting on Father Bourassa&rsquo;s veranda, on the outskirts of the
      town, above the great river, along which had travelled millions of bygone
      people, fighting, roaming, hunting, trapping; and they could hear it
      rushing past, see the swirling eddies, the impetuous currents, the
      occasional rafts moving majestically down the stream. They were facing the
      wild North, where civilisation was hacking and hewing and ploughing its
      way to newer and newer cities, in an empire ever spreading to the Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finden&rsquo;s glance loitered on this scene before he replied. At length,
      screwing up one eye, and with a suggestive smile, he answered: &ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s
      all a matter of time, to the selfishest woman. &lsquo;Tis not the same with
      women as with men; you see, they don&rsquo;t get younger&mdash;that&rsquo;s a point.
      But&rdquo;&mdash;he gave a meaning glance at the priest&mdash;&ldquo;but perhaps she&rsquo;s
      not going to wait for that, after all. And there he rides, a fine figure
      of a man, too, if I have to say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Varley?&rdquo; the priest responded, and watched a galloping horseman
      to whom Finden had pointed, till he rounded the corner of a little wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varley, the great London surgeon, sure! Say, father, it&rsquo;s a hundred to
      one she&rsquo;d take him, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious look in Father Bourassa&rsquo;s face, a cloud in his eyes.
      He sighed. &ldquo;London, it is ver&rsquo; far away,&rdquo; he remarked obliquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to that? If she is with the right man, near or far is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far&mdash;from home,&rdquo; said the priest reflectively, but his eyes
      furtively watched the other&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But home&rsquo;s where man and wife are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest now looked him straight in the eyes. &ldquo;Then, as you say, she
      will not marry M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Varley&mdash;hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The humour died out of Finden&rsquo;s face. His eyes met the priest&rsquo;s eyes
      steadily. &ldquo;Did I say that? Then my tongue wasn&rsquo;t making a fool of me,
      after all. How did you guess I knew&mdash;everything, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest knows many t&rsquo;ings&mdash;so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of gloom, then the Irishman brightened. He came
      straight to the heart of the mystery around which they had been
      maneuvering. &ldquo;Have you seen her husband&mdash;Meydon&mdash;this year? It
      isn&rsquo;t his usual time to come yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Bourassa&rsquo;s eyes drew those of his friend into, the light of a new
      understanding and revelation. They understood and trusted each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helas! He is there in the hospital,&rdquo; he answered, and nodded towards a
      building not far away, which had been part of an old Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
      Company&rsquo;s fort. It had been hastily adapted as a hospital for the smallpox
      victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Meydon, is it, that bad case I heard of to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest nodded again and &lsquo;pointed. &ldquo;Voila, Madame Meydon, she is
      coming. She has seen him&mdash;her hoosban&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden&rsquo;s eyes followed the gesture. The little widow of Jansen was coming
      from the hospital, walking slowly towards the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As purty a woman, too&mdash;as purty and as straight bewhiles. What is
      the matter with him&mdash;with Meydon?&rdquo; Finden asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident in the woods&mdash;so. He arrive, it is las&rsquo; night, from
      Great Slave Lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden sighed. &ldquo;Ten years ago he was a man to look at twice&mdash;before
      he did It and got away. Now his own mother wouldn&rsquo;t know him&mdash;bad
      &lsquo;cess to him! I knew him from the cradle almost. I spotted him here by a
      knife-cut I gave him in the hand when we were lads together. A divil of a
      timper always both of us had, but the good-nature was with me, and I
      didn&rsquo;t drink and gamble and carry a pistol. It&rsquo;s ten years since he did
      the killing, down in Quebec, and I don&rsquo;t suppose the police will get him
      now. He&rsquo;s been counted dead. I recognised him here the night after I asked
      her how she liked the name of Finden. She doesn&rsquo;t know that I ever knew
      him. And he didn&rsquo;t recognise me-twenty-five years since we met before! It
      would be better if he went under the sod. Is he pretty sick, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will die unless the surgeon&rsquo;s knife it cure him before twenty-four
      hours, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Doctor Brydon is sick, and Doctor Hadley away at Winnipeg, and this
      is two hundred miles from nowhere! It looks as if the police&rsquo;ll never get
      him, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not tell any one&mdash;never?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden laughed. &ldquo;Though I&rsquo;m not a priest, I can lock myself up as tight as
      anny. There&rsquo;s no tongue that&rsquo;s so tied, when tying&rsquo;s needed, as the one
      that babbles most bewhiles. Babbling covers a lot of secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you t&rsquo;ink it better Meydon should die, as Hadley is away and Brydon is
      sick-hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden stopped short, for a horse&rsquo;s hoofs sounded on the turf beside the
      house, and presently Varley, the great London surgeon, rounded the corner
      and stopped his horse in front of the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hat to the priest. &ldquo;I hear there&rsquo;s a bad case at the
      hospital,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ver&rsquo; dangerous,&rdquo; answered Father Bourassa; &ldquo;but, voila, come in!
      There is something cool to drink. Ah yes, he is ver&rsquo; bad, that man from
      the Great Slave Lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inside the house, with the cooling drinks, Varley pressed his questions,
      and presently, much interested, told at some length of singular cases
      which had passed through his hands&mdash;one a man with his neck broken,
      who had lived for six months afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken as a man&rsquo;s neck is broken by hanging&mdash;dislocation, really&mdash;the
      disjointing of the medulla oblongata, if you don&rsquo;t mind technicalities,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;But I kept him living just the same. Time enough for him to
      repent in and get ready to go. A most interesting case. He was a criminal,
      too, and wanted to die; but you have to keep life going if you can, to the
      last inch of resistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest looked thoughtfully out of the window; Finden&rsquo;s eyes were
      screwed up in a questioning way, but neither made any response to Varley&rsquo;s
      remarks. There was a long minute&rsquo;s silence. They were all three roused by
      hearing a light footstep on the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Bourassa put down his glass and hastened into the hallway. Finden
      caught a glimpse of a woman&rsquo;s figure, and, without a word, passed abruptly
      from the dining-room where they were, into the priest&rsquo;s study, leaving
      Varley alone. Varley turned to look after him, stared, and shrugged his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manners of the West,&rdquo; he said good-humouredly, and turned again to
      the hallway, from whence came the sound of the priest&rsquo;s voice. Presently
      there was another voice&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s. He flushed slightly and
      involuntarily straightened himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valerie,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant afterwards she entered the room with the priest. She was
      dressed in a severely simple suit of grey, which set off to advantage her
      slim, graceful figure. There seemed no reason why she should have been
      called the little widow of Jansen, for she was not small, but she was very
      finely and delicately made, and the name had been but an expression of
      Jansen&rsquo;s paternal feeling for her. She had always had a good deal of fresh
      colour, but to-day she seemed pale, though her eyes had a strange
      disturbing light. It was not that they brightened on seeing this man
      before her; they had been brighter, burningly bright, when she left the
      hospital, where, since it had been built, she had been the one visitor of
      authority&mdash;Jansen had given her that honour. She had a gift of
      smiling, and she smiled now, but it came from grace of mind rather than
      from humour. As Finden had said, &ldquo;She was for ever acting, and never doin&rsquo; 
      any harm by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly she was doing no harm by it now; nevertheless, it was acting.
      Could it be otherwise, with what was behind her life&mdash;a husband who
      had ruined her youth, had committed homicide, had escaped capture, but who
      had not subsequently died, as the world believed he had done, so
      circumstantial was the evidence. He was not man enough to make the
      accepted belief in his death a fact. What could she do but act, since the
      day she got a letter from the Far North, which took her out to Jansen,
      nominally to nurse those stricken with smallpox under Father Bourassa&rsquo;s
      care, actually to be where her wretched husband could come to her once a
      year, as he had asked with an impossible selfishness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year she had seen him for an hour or less, giving him money, speaking
      to him over a gulf so wide that it seemed sometimes as though her voice
      could not be heard across it; each year opening a grave to look at the
      embalmed face of one who had long since died in shame, which only brought
      back the cruellest of all memories, that which one would give one&rsquo;s best
      years to forget. With a fortitude beyond description she had faced it,
      gently, quietly, but firmly faced it&mdash;firmly, because she had to be
      firm in keeping him within those bounds the invasion of which would have
      killed her. And after the first struggle with his unchangeable brutality
      it had been easier: for into his degenerate brain there had come a faint
      understanding of the real situation and of her. He had kept his side of
      the gulf, but gloating on this touch between the old luxurious, indulgent
      life, with its refined vices, and this present coarse, hard life, where
      pleasures were few and gross. The free Northern life of toil and hardship
      had not refined him. He greedily hung over this treasure, which was not
      for his spending, yet was his own&mdash;as though in a bank he had hoards
      of money which he might not withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the years had gone on, with their recurrent dreaded anniversaries,
      carrying misery almost too great to be borne by this woman mated to the
      loathed phantom of a sad, dead life; and when this black day of each year
      was over, for a few days afterwards she went nowhere, was seen by none.
      Yet, when she did appear again, it was with her old laughing manner, her
      cheerful and teasing words, her quick response to the emotions of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it had gone till Varley had come to follow the open air life for four
      months, after a heavy illness due to blood-poisoning got in his surgical
      work in London. She had been able to live her life without too great a
      struggle till he came. Other men had flattered her vanity, had given her a
      sense of power, had made her understand her possibilities, but nothing
      more&mdash;nothing of what Varley brought with him. And before three
      months had gone, she knew that no man had ever interested her as Varley
      had done. Ten years before, she would not have appreciated or understood
      him, this intellectual, clean-shaven, rigidly abstemious man, whose
      pleasures belonged to the fishing-rod and the gun and the horse, and who
      had come to be so great a friend of him who had been her best friend&mdash;Father
      Bourassa. Father Bourassa had come to know the truth&mdash;not from her,
      for she had ever been a Protestant, but from her husband, who, Catholic by
      birth and a renegade from all religion, had had a moment of spurious
      emotion, when he went and confessed to Father Bourassa and got absolution,
      pleading for the priest&rsquo;s care of his wife. Afterwards Father Bourassa
      made up his mind that the confession had a purpose behind it other than
      repentance, and he deeply resented the use to which he thought he was
      being put&mdash;a kind of spy upon the beautiful woman whom Jansen loved,
      and who, in spite of any outward flippancy, was above reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vital things the instinct becomes abnormally acute, and, one day, when
      the priest looked at her commiseratingly, she had divined what moved him.
      However it was, she drove him into a corner with a question to which he
      dare not answer yes, but to which he might not answer no, and did not; and
      she realised that he knew the truth, and she was the better for his
      knowing, though her secret was no longer a secret. She was not aware that
      Finden also knew. Then Varley came, bringing a new joy and interest in her
      life, and a new suffering also, for she realised that if she were free,
      and Varley asked her to marry him, she would consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he did ask her, she said no with a pang that cut her heart in
      two. He had stayed his four months, and it was now six months, and he was
      going at last-tomorrow. He had stayed to give her time to learn to say
      yes, and to take her back with him to London; and she knew that he would
      speak again to-day, and that she must say no again; but she had kept him
      from saying the words till now. And the man who had ruined her life and
      had poisoned her true spirit was come back broken and battered. He was
      hanging between life and death; and now&mdash;for he was going to-morrow&mdash;Varley
      would speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-hour she had just spent in the hospital with Meydon had tried her
      cruelly. She had left the building in a vortex of conflicting emotions,
      with the call of duty and of honour ringing through a thousand other
      voices of temptation and desire, the inner pleadings for a little
      happiness while yet she was young. After she married Meydon, there had
      only been a few short weeks of joy before her black disillusion came, and
      she had realised how bitter must be her martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left the hospital, she seemed moving in a dream, as one,
      intoxicated by some elixir, might move unheeding among event and accident
      and vexing life and roaring multitudes. And all the while the river
      flowing through the endless prairies, high-banked, ennobled by living
      woods, lipped with green, kept surging in her ears, inviting her, alluring
      her&mdash;alluring her with a force too deep and powerful for weak human
      nature to bear for long. It would ease her pain, it said; it would still
      the tumult and the storm; it would solve her problem, it would give her
      peace. But as she moved along the river-bank among the trees, she met the
      little niece of the priest, who lived in his house, singing as though she
      was born but to sing, a song which Finden had written and Father Bourassa
      had set to music. Did not the distant West know Father Bourassa&rsquo;s gift,
      and did not Protestants attend Mass to hear him play the organ afterwards?
      The fresh, clear voice of the child rang through the trees, stealing the
      stricken heart away from the lure of the river:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Will you come back home, where the young larks are singin&rsquo;?
   The door is open wide, and the bells of Lynn are ringin&rsquo;;
     There&rsquo;s a little lake I know,
     And a boat you used to row
   To the shore beyond that&rsquo;s quiet&mdash;will you come back home?

   Will you come back, darlin&rsquo;? Never heed the pain and blightin&rsquo;,
   Never trouble that you&rsquo;re wounded, that you bear the scars of
   fightin&rsquo;;
     Here&rsquo;s the luck o&rsquo; Heaven to you,
     Here&rsquo;s the hand of love will brew you
   The cup of peace&mdash;ah, darlin&rsquo;, will you come back home?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She stood listening for a few moments, and, under the spell of the fresh,
      young voice, the homely, heart-searching words, and the intimate sweetness
      of the woods, the despairing apathy lifted slowly away. She started
      forwards again with a new understanding, her footsteps quickened. She
      would go to Father Bourassa. He would understand. She would tell him all.
      He would help her to do what now she knew she must do, ask Leonard Varley
      to save her husband&rsquo;s life&mdash;Leonard Varley to save her husband&rsquo;s
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she stepped upon the veranda of the priest&rsquo;s house, she did not know
      that Varley was inside. She had no time to think. She was ushered into the
      room where he was, with the confusing fact of his presence fresh upon her.
      She had had but a word or two with the priest, but enough for him to know
      what she meant to do, and that it must be done at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varley advanced to meet her. She shuddered inwardly to think what a
      difference there was between the fallen creature she had left behind in
      the hospital and this tall, dark, self-contained man, whose name was
      familiar in the surgeries of Europe, who had climbed from being the son of
      a clockmaker to his present distinguished place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come for absolution, also?&rdquo; he asked with a smile; &ldquo;or is it to
      get a bill of excommunication against your only enemy&mdash;there couldn&rsquo;t
      be more than one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cheerful as his words were, he was shrewdly observing her, for her
      paleness, and the strange light in her eyes, gave him a sense of anxiety.
      He wondered what trouble was on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excommunication?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unintended truth went home. She winced, even as she responded with
      that quaint note in her voice which gave humour to her speech. &ldquo;Yes,
      excommunication,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but why an enemy? Do we not need to
      excommunicate our friends sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a hard saying,&rdquo; he answered soberly. Tears sprang to her eyes,
      but she mastered herself, and brought the crisis abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to save a man&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; she said, with her eyes looking
      straight into his. &ldquo;Will you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face grew grave and eager. &ldquo;I want you to save a man&rsquo;s happiness,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;Will you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man yonder will die unless your skill saves him,&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man here will go away unhappy and alone, unless your heart befriends
      him,&rdquo; he replied, coming closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At sunrise to-morrow he goes.&rdquo; He tried to take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, please,&rdquo; she pleaded, with a quick, protesting gesture.
      &ldquo;Sunrise is far off, but the man&rsquo;s fate is near, and you must save him.
      You only can do so, for Doctor Hadley is away, and Doctor Brydon is sick,
      and in any case Doctor Brydon dare not attempt the operation alone. It is
      too critical and difficult, he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have heard,&rdquo; he answered, with a new note in his voice, his
      professional instinct roused in spite of himself. &ldquo;Who is this man? What
      interests you in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To how many unknown people have you given your skill for nothing&mdash;your
      skill and all your experience to utter strangers, no matter how low or
      poor! Is it not so? Well, I cannot give to strangers what you have given
      to so many, but I can help in my own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to see the man at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name? I know of his accident and the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for an instant, then said, &ldquo;He is called Draper&mdash;a
      trapper and woodsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was going away to-morrow at sunrise. All my arrangements are made,&rdquo;
       he urged, his eyes holding hers, his passion swimming in his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not see a man die, if you can save him?&rdquo; she pleaded, unable
      now to meet his look, its mastery and its depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart had almost leaped with joy at the suggestion that he could not
      stay; but as suddenly self-reproach and shame filled her mind, and she had
      challenged him so. But yet, what right had she to sacrifice this man she
      loved to the perverted criminal who had spoiled her youth and taken away
      from her every dear illusion of her life and heart? By every right of
      justice and humanity she was no more the wife of Henry Meydon than if she
      had never seen him. He had forfeited every claim upon her, dragged in the
      mire her unspotted life&mdash;unspotted, for in all temptation, in her
      defenceless position, she had kept the whole commandment; she had, while
      at the mercy of her own temperament, fought her way through all, with a
      weeping heart and laughing lips. Had she not longed for a little home with
      a great love, and a strong, true man? Ah, it had been lonely, bitterly
      lonely! Yet she had remained true to the scoundrel, from whom she could
      not free herself without putting him in the grasp of the law to atone for
      his crime. She was punished for his crimes; she was denied the exercise of
      her womanhood in order to shield him. Still she remembered that once she
      had loved him, those years ago, when he first won her heart from those so
      much better than he, who loved her so much more honestly; and this memory
      had helped her in a way. She had tried to be true to it, that dead, lost
      thing, of which this man who came once a year to see her, and now, lying
      with his life at stake in the hospital, was the repellent ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you will not see him die?&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to move you greatly what happens to this man,&rdquo; he said, his
      determined dark eyes searching hers, for she baffled him. If she could
      feel so much for a &ldquo;casual,&rdquo; why not a little more feeling for him?
      Suddenly, as he drew her eyes to him again, there came the conviction that
      they were full of feeling for him. They were sending a message, an
      appealing, passionate message, which told him more than he had ever heard
      from her or seen in her face before. Yes, she was his! Without a spoken
      word she had told him so. What, then, held her back? But women were a race
      by themselves, and he knew that he must wait till she chose to have him
      know what she had unintentionally conveyed but now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am moved,&rdquo; she continued slowly. &ldquo;Who can tell what this man might
      do with his life, if it is saved! Don&rsquo;t you think of that? It isn&rsquo;t the
      importance of a life that&rsquo;s at stake; it&rsquo;s the importance of living; and
      we do not live alone, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mind was made up. &ldquo;I will not, cannot promise anything till I have
      seen him. But I will go and see him, and I&rsquo;ll send you word later what I
      can do, or not do. Will that satisfy you? If I cannot do it, I will come
      to say good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face was set with suppressed feeling. She held out her hand to him
      impulsively, and was about to speak, but suddenly caught the hand away
      again from his thrilling grasp and, turning hurriedly, left the room. In
      the hall she met Father Bourassa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with him to the hospital,&rdquo; she whispered, and disappeared through the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after she had gone, a man came driving hard to bring Father
      Bourassa to visit a dying Catholic in the prairie, and it was Finden who
      accompanied Varley to the hospital, waited for him till his examination of
      the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; was concluded, and met him outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be done?&rdquo; he asked of Varley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take word to Father Bourassa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be done&mdash;it will be done,&rdquo; answered Varley absently. &ldquo;I do
      not understand the man. He has been in a different sphere of life. He
      tried to hide it, but the speech&mdash;occasionally! I wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonder if he&rsquo;s worth saving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varley shrugged his shoulders impatiently. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finden smiled to himself. &ldquo;Is it a difficult case?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Critical and delicate; but it has been my specialty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the local doctors couldn&rsquo;t do it, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be foolish to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going away at sunrise to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; Varley&rsquo;s voice was abrupt, impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you say so-everybody knows it.... That&rsquo;s a bad man yonder,
      Varley.&rdquo; He jerked his thumb towards the hospital. &ldquo;A terrible bad man,
      he&rsquo;s been. A gentleman once, and fell down&mdash;fell down hard. He&rsquo;s done
      more harm than most men. He&rsquo;s broken a woman&rsquo;s heart and spoilt her life,
      and, if he lives, there&rsquo;s no chance for her, none at all. He killed a man,
      and the law wants him; and she can&rsquo;t free herself without ruining him; and
      she can&rsquo;t marry the man she loves because of that villain yonder, crying
      for his life to be saved. By Josh and by Joan, but it&rsquo;s a shame, a dirty
      shame, it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Varley turned and gripped his arm with fingers of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name&mdash;his real name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Meydon&mdash;and a dirty shame it is, Varley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varley was white. He had been leading his horse and talking to Finden. He
      mounted quickly now, and was about to ride away, but stopped short again.
      &ldquo;Who knows&mdash;who knows the truth?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Bourassa and me&mdash;no others,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I knew Meydon
      thirty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, then Varley said hoarsely, &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;tell
      me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When all was told, he turned his horse towards the wide waste of the
      prairie, and galloped away. Finden watched him till he was lost to view
      beyond the bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, a man like that, you can&rsquo;t guess what he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said
      reflectively. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a high-stepper, and there&rsquo;s no telling what
      foolishness will get hold of him. It&rsquo;d be safer if he got lost on the
      prairie for twenty-four hours. He said that Meydon&rsquo;s only got twenty-four
      hours, if the trick isn&rsquo;t done! Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a penny from his pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toss for it. Heads he does it, and
      tails he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed. It came down heads. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one more fool in the world
      than I thought,&rdquo; he said philosophically, as though he had settled the
      question; as though the man riding away into the prairie with a dark
      problem to be solved had told the penny what he meant to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meydon, Father Bourassa, and Finden stood in the little waiting-room
      of the hospital at Jansen, one at each window, and watched the wild
      thunderstorm which had broken over the prairie. The white heliographs of
      the elements flashed their warnings across the black sky, and the roaring
      artillery of the thunder came after, making the circle of prairie and tree
      and stream a theatre of anger and conflict. The streets of Jansen were
      washed with flood, and the green and gold things of garden and field and
      harvest crumbled beneath the sheets of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces at the window of the little room of the hospital, however, were
      but half-conscious of the storm; it seemed only an accompaniment of their
      thoughts, to typify the elements of tragedy surrounding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Varley there had been but one thing to do. A life might be saved, and
      it was his duty to save it. He had ridden back from the prairie as the sun
      was setting the night before, and had made all arrangements at the
      hospital, giving orders that Meydon should have no food whatever till the
      operation was performed the next afternoon, and nothing to drink except a
      little brandy-and-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation was performed successfully, and Varley had issued from the
      operating-room with the look of a man who had gone through an ordeal which
      had taxed his nerve to the utmost, to find Valerie Meydon waiting, with a
      piteous, dazed look in her eyes. But this look passed when she heard him
      say, &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; The words brought a sense of relief, for if he had
      failed it would have seemed almost unbearable in the circumstances&mdash;the
      cup of trembling must be drunk to the dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few words had passed between them, and he had gone, while she remained
      behind with Father Bourassa, till the patient should wake from the sleep
      into which he had fallen when Varley left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But within two hours they sent for Varley again, for Meydon was in evident
      danger. Varley had come, and had now been with the patient for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the door opened and Varley came in quickly. He beckoned to Mrs.
      Meydon and to Father Bourassa. &ldquo;He wishes to speak with you,&rdquo; he said to
      her. &ldquo;There is little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes scarcely saw him, as she left the room and passed to where Meydon
      lay nerveless, but with wide-open eyes, waiting for her. The eyes closed,
      however, before she reached the bed. Presently they opened again, but the
      lids remained fixed. He did not hear what she said.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        ......................
</pre>
    <p>
      In the little waiting-room, Finden said to Varley, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Food was absolutely forbidden, but he got it from another patient early
      this morning while the nurse was out for a moment. It has killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas the least he could do, but no credit&rsquo;s due him. It was to be. I&rsquo;m
      not envying Father Bourassa nor her there with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varley made no reply. He was watching the receding storm with eyes which
      told nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finden spoke once more, but Varley did not hear him. Presently the door
      opened and Father Bourassa entered. He made a gesture of the hand to
      signify that all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the sun was breaking through the clouds upon the Western prairie,
      and there floated through the evening air the sound of a child&rsquo;s voice
      singing beneath the trees that fringed the river:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Will you come back, darlin&rsquo;? Never heed the pain and blightin&rsquo;,
   Never trouble that you&rsquo;re wounded, that you bear the scars of
   fightin&rsquo;;
     Here&rsquo;s the luck o&rsquo; Heaven to you,
     Here&rsquo;s the hand of love will brew you
   The cup of peace-ah, darlin&rsquo;, will you come back home?&rdquo;
 </pre>

    <h2>
      WATCHING THE RISE OF ORION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all the wide border his steed was the best,&rdquo; and the name and fame of
      Terence O&rsquo;Ryan were known from Strathcona to Qu&rsquo;appelle. He had ambition
      of several kinds, and he had the virtue of not caring who knew of it. He
      had no guile, and little money; but never a day&rsquo;s work was too hard for
      him, and he took bad luck, when it came, with a jerk of the shoulder and a
      good-natured surprise on his clean-shaven face that suited well his wide
      grey eyes and large, luxurious mouth. He had an estate, half ranch, half
      farm, with a French Canadian manager named Vigon, an old prospector who
      viewed every foot of land in the world with the eye of the discoverer.
      Gold, coal, iron, oil, he searched for them everywhere, making sure that
      sooner or later he would find them. Once Vigon had found coal. That was
      when he worked for a man called Constantine Jopp, and had given him great
      profit; but he, the discoverer, had been put off with a horse and a
      hundred dollars. He was now as devoted to Terence O&rsquo;Ryan as he had been
      faithful to Constantine Jopp, whom he cursed waking and sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his time O&rsquo;Ryan had speculated, and lost; he had floated a coal mine,
      and &ldquo;been had&rdquo;; he had run for the local legislature, had been elected,
      and then unseated for bribery committed by an agent; he had run races at
      Regina, and won&mdash;he had won for three years in succession; and this
      had kept him going and restored his finances when they were at their
      worst. He was, in truth, the best rider in the country, and, so far, was
      the owner also of the best three-year-old that the West had produced. He
      achieved popularity without effort. The West laughed at his enterprises
      and loved him; he was at once a public moral and a hero. It was a legend
      of the West that his forbears had been kings in Ireland like Brian
      Borhoime. He did not contradict this; he never contradicted anything. His
      challenge to all fun and satire and misrepresentation was, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll be the
      differ a hundred years from now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not use this phrase, however, towards one experience&mdash;the
      advent of Miss Molly Mackinder, the heiress, and the challenge that
      reverberated through the West after her arrival. Philosophy deserted him
      then; he fell back on the primary emotions of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month after Miss Mackinder&rsquo;s arrival at La Touche a dramatic performance
      was given at the old fort, in which the officers of the Mounted Police
      took part, together with many civilians who fancied themselves. By that
      time the district had realised that Terry O&rsquo;Ryan had surrendered to what
      they called &ldquo;the laying on of hands&rdquo; by Molly Mackinder. It was not
      certain, however, that the surrender was complete, because O&rsquo;Ryan had been
      wounded before, and yet had not been taken captive altogether. His
      complete surrender seemed now more certain to the public because the lady
      had a fortune of two hundred thousand dollars, and that amount of money
      would be useful to an ambitious man in the growing West. It would, as Gow
      Johnson said, &ldquo;Let him sit back and view the landscape o&rsquo;er, before he
      puts his ploughshare in the mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an outdoor scene in the play produced by the impetuous amateurs,
      and dialogue had been interpolated by three &ldquo;imps of fame&rdquo; at the
      suggestion of Constantine Jopp, one of the three, who bore malice towards
      O&rsquo;Ryan, though this his colleagues did not know distinctly. The scene was
      a camp-fire&mdash;a starlit night, a colloquy between the three, upon
      which the hero of the drama, played by Terry O&rsquo;Ryan, should break, after
      having, unknown to them, but in sight of the audience, overheard their
      kind of intentions towards himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night came. When the curtain rose for the third act there was exposed
      a star-sown sky, in which the galaxy of Orion was shown with distinctness,
      each star sharply twinkling from the electric power behind-a pretty scene
      evoking great applause. O&rsquo;Ryan had never seen this back curtain&mdash;they
      had taken care that he should not&mdash;and, standing in the wings
      awaiting his cue, he was unprepared for the laughter of the audience,
      first low and uncertain, then growing, then insistent, and now a peal of
      ungovernable mirth, as one by one they understood the significance of the
      stars of Orion on the back curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Ryan got his cue, and came on to an outburst of applause which shook the
      walls. La Touche rose at him, among them Miss Molly Mackinder in the front
      row with the notables.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see the back curtain, or Orion blazing in the ultramarine blue.
      According to the stage directions, he was to steal along the trees at the
      wings, and listen to the talk of the men at the fire plotting against him,
      who were presently to pretend good comradeship to his face. It was a
      vigorous melodrama with some touches of true Western feeling. After
      listening for a moment, O&rsquo;Ryan was to creep up the stage again towards the
      back curtain, giving a cue for his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hilarious applause at his entrance had somewhat subsided, the
      three took up their parable, but it was not the parable of the play. They
      used dialogue not in the original. It had a significance which the
      audience were not slow to appreciate, and went far to turn &ldquo;The Sunburst
      Trail&rdquo; at this point into a comedy-farce. When this new dialogue began,
      O&rsquo;Ryan could scarcely trust his ears, or realise what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, look,&rdquo; said Dicky Fergus at the fire, &ldquo;as fine a night as ever I saw
      in the West! The sky&rsquo;s a picture. You could almost hand the stars down,
      they&rsquo;re so near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that clump together on the right&mdash;what are they called in
      astronomy?&rdquo; asked Constantine Jopp, with a leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orion is the name&mdash;a beauty, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; answered Fergus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching Orion rise,&rdquo; said the third&mdash;Holden was his name.
      &ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve watched Orion rising. Orion&rsquo;s the star for me. Say,
      he wipes &lsquo;em all out&mdash;right out. Watch him rising now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a manipulation of the lights Orion moved up the back curtain slowly,
      and blazed with light nearer the zenith. And La Touche had more than the
      worth of its money in this opening to the third act of the play. O&rsquo;Ryan
      was a favourite, at whom La Touche loved to jeer, and the parable of the
      stars convulsed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first words O&rsquo;Ryan put a hand on himself and tried to grasp the
      meaning of it all, but his entrance and the subsequent applause had
      confused him. Presently, however, he turned to the back curtain, as Orion
      moved slowly up the heavens, and found the key to the situation. He
      gasped. Then he listened to the dialogue which had nothing to do with &ldquo;The
      Sunburst Trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Orion do, and why does he rise? Has he got to rise? Why was the
      gent called Orion in them far-off days?&rdquo; asked Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did some hunting in his time&mdash;with a club,&rdquo; Fergus replied. &ldquo;He
      kept making hits, he did. Orion was a spoiler. When he took the field
      there was no room for the rest of the race. Why does he rise? Because it
      is a habit. They could always get a rise out of Orion. The Athens
      Eirenicon said that yeast might fail to rise, but touch the button and
      Orion would rise like a bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the galaxy jerked up the back curtain again, and when the
      audience could control itself, Constantine Jopp, grinning meanly, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he wear the girdle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a girdle&mdash;it is a belt,&rdquo; was Dicky Fergus&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The
      gods gave it to him because he was a favourite. There was a lady called
      Artemis&mdash;she was the last of them. But he went visiting with Eos,
      another lady of previous acquaintance, down at a place called Ortygia, and
      Artemis shot him dead with a shaft Apollo had given her; but she didn&rsquo;t
      marry Apollo neither. She laid Orion out on the sky, with his glittering
      belt, around him. And Orion keeps on rising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he ever stop rising?&rdquo; asked Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed for the conspirators a disconcerting moment; for, when the
      laughter had subsided, a lazy voice came from the back of the hall, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
      stop long enough to play with Apollo a little, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Gow Johnson who had spoken, and no man knew Terry O&rsquo;Ryan better, or
      could gauge more truly the course he would take. He had been in many an
      enterprise, many a brush with O&rsquo;Ryan, and his friendship would bear any
      strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Ryan recovered himself from the moment he saw the back curtain, and he
      did not find any fun in the thing. It took a hold on him out of all
      proportion to its importance. He realised that he had come to the parting
      of the ways in his life. It suddenly came upon him that something had been
      lacking in him in the past; and that his want of success in many things
      had not been wholly due to bad luck. He had been eager, enterprising, a
      genius almost at seeing good things; and yet others had reaped where he
      had sown. He had believed too much in his fellow-man. For the first time
      in his life he resented the friendly, almost affectionate satire of his
      many friends. It was amusing, it was delightful; but down beneath it all
      there was a little touch of ridicule. He had more brains than any of them,
      and he had known it in a way; he had led them sometimes, too, as on raids
      against cattle-stealers, and in a brush with half-breeds and Indians; as
      when he stood for the legislature; but he felt now for the first time that
      he had not made the most of himself, that there was something hurting to
      self-respect in this prank played upon him. When he came to that point his
      resentment went higher. He thought of Molly Mackinder, and he heard all
      too acutely the vague veiled references to her in their satire. By the
      time Gow Johnson spoke he had mastered himself, however, and had made up
      his mind. He stood still for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, please, my cue,&rdquo; he said quietly and satirically from the trees near
      the wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was smiling, but Gow Johnson&rsquo;s prognostication was right; and ere long
      the audience realised that he was right. There was standing before them
      not the Terry O&rsquo;Ryan they had known, but another. He threw himself fully
      into his part&mdash;a young rancher made deputy sheriff, who by the
      occasional exercise of his duty had incurred the hatred of a small
      floating population that lived by fraud, violence, and cattle-stealing.
      The conspiracy was to raid his cattle, to lure him to pursuit, to ambush
      him, and kill him. Terry now played the part with a naturalness and force
      which soon lifted the play away from the farcical element introduced into
      it by those who had interpolated the gibes at himself. They had gone a
      step too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going large,&rdquo; said Gow Johnson, as the act drew near its close, and
      the climax neared, where O&rsquo;Ryan was to enter upon a physical struggle with
      his assailants. &ldquo;His blood&rsquo;s up. There&rsquo;ll be hell to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Gow Johnson the play had instantly become real, and O&rsquo;Ryan an injured
      man at bay, the victim of the act&mdash;not of the fictitious characters
      of the play, but of the three men, Fergus, Holden, and Constantine Jopp,
      who had planned the discomfiture of O&rsquo;Ryan; and he felt that the victim&rsquo;s
      resentment would fall heaviest on Constantine Jopp, the bully, an old
      schoolmate of Terry&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jopp was older than O&rsquo;Ryan by three years, which in men is little, but in
      boys, at a certain time of life, is much. It means, generally, weight and
      height, an advantage in a scrimmage. Constantine Jopp had been the plague
      and tyrant of O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s boyhood. He was now a big, leering fellow with much
      money of his own, got chiefly from the coal discovered on his place by
      Vigon, the half-breed French Canadian. He had a sense of dark and
      malicious humour, a long horse-like face, with little beady eyes and a
      huge frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again had Terry fought him as a boy at school, and often he had
      been badly whipped, but he had never refused the challenge of an insult
      when he was twelve and Jopp fifteen. The climax to their enmity at school
      had come one day when Terry was seized with a cramp while bathing, and
      after having gone down twice was rescued by Jopp, who dragged him out by
      the hair of the head. He had been restored to consciousness on the bank
      and carried to his home, where he lay ill for days. During the course of
      the slight fever which followed the accident his hair was cut close to his
      head. Impetuous always, his first thought was to go and thank Constantine
      Jopp for having saved his life. As soon as he was able he went forth to
      find his rescuer, and met him suddenly on turning a corner of the street.
      Before he could stammer out the gratitude that was in his heart, Jopp,
      eyeing him with a sneering smile, said drawlingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d had your hair cut like that I couldn&rsquo;t have got you out, could
      I? Holy, what a sight! Next time I&rsquo;ll take you by the scruff, putty-face&mdash;bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for Terry. He had swallowed the insult, stuttered his
      thanks to the jeering laugh of the lank bully, and had gone home and cried
      in shame and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the one real shadow in his life. Ill luck and good luck had been
      taken with an equable mind; but the fact that he must, while he lived, own
      the supreme debt of his life to a boy and afterwards to a man whom he
      hated by instinct was a constant cloud on him. Jopp owned him. For some
      years they did not meet, and then at last they again were thrown together
      in the West, when Jopp settled at La Touche. It was gall and wormwood to
      Terry, but he steeled himself to be friendly, although the man was as
      great a bully as the boy, as offensive in mind and character; but withal
      acute and able in his way, and with a reputation for commercial sharpness
      which would be called by another name in a different civilisation. They
      met constantly, and O&rsquo;Ryan always put a hand on himself, and forced
      himself to be friendly. Once when Jopp became desperately ill there had
      been&mdash;though he fought it down, and condemned himself in every term
      of reproach&mdash;a sense of relief in the thought that perhaps his
      ancient debt would now be cancelled. It had gone on so long. And
      Constantine Jopp had never lost an opportunity of vexing him, of torturing
      him, of giving veiled thrusts, which he knew O&rsquo;Ryan could not resent. It
      was the constant pin-prick of a mean soul, who had an advantage of which
      he could never be dispossessed&mdash;unless the ledger was balanced in
      some inscrutable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently bent on amusement only, and hiding his hatred from his
      colleagues, Jopp had been the instigator and begetter of the huge joke of
      the play; but it was the brains of Dick Fergus which had carried it out,
      written the dialogue, and planned the electric appliances of the back
      curtain&mdash;for he was an engineer and electrician. Neither he nor
      Holden had known the old antipathy of Terry and Constantine Jopp. There
      was only one man who knew the whole truth, and that was Gow Johnson, to
      whom Terry had once told all. At the last moment Fergus had interpolated
      certain points in the dialogue which were not even included at rehearsal.
      These referred to Apollo. He had a shrewd notion that Jopp had an idea of
      marrying Molly Mackinder if he could, cousins though they were; and he was
      also aware that Jopp, knowing Molly&rsquo;s liking for Terry, had tried to
      poison her mind against him, through suggestive gossip about a little
      widow at Jansen, thirty miles away. He had in so far succeeded that, on
      the very day of the performance, Molly had declined to be driven home from
      the race-course by Terry, despite the fact that Terry had won the chief
      race and owned the only dog-cart in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day went on Fergus realised, as had Gow Johnson, that Jopp had
      raised a demon. The air was electric. The play was drawing near to its
      climax&mdash;an attempt to capture the deputy sheriff, tie him to a tree,
      and leave him bound and gagged alone in the waste. There was a glitter in
      Terry&rsquo;s eyes, belying the lips which smiled in keeping with the character
      he presented. A look of hardness was stamped on his face, and the outlines
      of the temples were as sharp as the chin was set and the voice slow and
      penetrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly Mackinder&rsquo;s eyes were riveted on him. She sat very still, her hands
      clasped in her lap, watching his every move. Instinct told her that Terry
      was holding himself in; that some latent fierceness and iron force in him
      had emerged into life; and that he meant to have revenge on Constantine
      Jopp one way or another, and that soon; for she had heard the rumour
      flying through the hall that her cousin was the cause of the practical
      joke just played. From hints she had had from Constantine that very day
      she knew that the rumour was the truth; and she recalled now with
      shrinking dislike the grimace accompanying the suggestion. She had not
      resented it then, being herself angry with Terry because of the little
      widow at Jansen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the silence in the hall became acute; the senses of the audience
      were strained to the utmost. The acting before them was more realistic
      than anything they had ever seen, or were ever likely to see again in La
      Touche. All three conspirators, Fergus, Holden, and Jopp, realised that
      O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s acting had behind it an animal anger which transformed him. When
      he looked into their eyes it was with a steely directness harder and
      fiercer than was observed by the audience. Once there was occasion for
      O&rsquo;Ryan to catch Fergus by the arm, and Fergus winced from the grip. When
      standing in the wings with Terry he ventured to apologise playfully for
      the joke, but Terry made no answer; and once again he had whispered
      good-naturedly as they stood together on the stage; but the reply had been
      a low, scornful laugh. Fergus realised that a critical moment was at hand.
      The play provided for some dialogue between Jopp and Terry, and he
      observed with anxiety that Terry now interpolated certain phrases meant to
      warn Constantine, and to excite him to anger also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment came upon them sooner than the text of the play warranted.
      O&rsquo;Ryan deliberately left out several sentences, and gave a later cue, and
      the struggle for his capture was precipitated. Terry meant to make the
      struggle real. So thrilling had been the scene that to an extent the
      audience was prepared for what followed; but they did not grasp the full
      reality&mdash;that the play was now only a vehicle for a personal issue of
      a desperate character. No one had ever seen O&rsquo;Ryan angry; and now that the
      demon of rage was on him, directed by a will suddenly grown to its full
      height, they saw not only a powerful character in a powerful melodrama,
      but a man of wild force. When the three desperadoes closed in on O&rsquo;Ryan,
      and, with a blow from the shoulder which was not a pretence, he sent
      Holden into a far corner gasping for breath and moaning with pain, the
      audience broke out into wild cheering. It was superb acting, they thought.
      As most of them had never seen the play, they were not surprised when
      Holden did not again join the attack on the deputy sheriff. Those who did
      know the drama&mdash;among them Molly Mackinder&mdash;became dismayed,
      then anxious. Fergus and Jopp knew well from the blow O&rsquo;Ryan had given
      that, unless they could drag him down, the end must be disaster to some
      one. They were struggling with him for personal safety now. The play was
      forgotten, though mechanically O&rsquo;Ryan and Fergus repeated the exclamations
      and the few phrases belonging to the part. Jopp was silent, fighting with
      a malice which belongs to only half-breed, or half-bred, natures; and from
      far back in his own nature the distant Indian strain in him was working in
      savage hatred. The two were desperately hanging on to O&rsquo;Ryan like pumas on
      a grizzly, when suddenly, with a twist he had learned from Ogami the Jap
      on the Smoky River, the slim Fergus was slung backward to the ground with
      the tendons of his arm strained and the arm itself useless for further
      work. There remained now Constantine Jopp, heavier and more powerful than
      O&rsquo;Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
      For O&rsquo;Ryan the theatre, the people, disappeared. He was a boy again on the
      village green, with the bully before him who had tortured his young days.
      He forgot the old debt to the foe who saved his life; he forgot
      everything, except that once again, as of old, Constantine Jopp was
      fighting him, with long, strong arms trying to bring him to the ground.
      Jopp&rsquo;s superior height gave him an advantage in a close grip; the strength
      of his gorilla-like arms was difficult to withstand. Both were forgetful
      of the world, and the two other injured men, silent and awed, were
      watching the fight, in which one of them, at least, was powerless to take
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience was breathless. Most now saw the grim reality of the scene
      before them; and when at last O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s powerful right hand got a grip upon
      the throat of Jopp, and they saw the grip tighten, tighten, and Jopp&rsquo;s
      face go from red to purple, a hundred people gasped. Excited men made as
      though to move toward the stage; but the majority still believed that it
      all belonged to the play, and shouted &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the voice of Gow Johnson was heard &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill him&mdash;let go,
      boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice rang out with sharp anxiety, and pierced the fog of passion and
      rage in which O&rsquo;Ryan was moving. He realised what he was doing, the real
      sense of it came upon him. Suddenly he let go the lank throat of his
      enemy, and, by a supreme effort, flung him across the stage, where Jopp
      lay resting on his hands, his bleared eyes looking at Terry with the fear
      and horror still in them which had come with that tightening grip on his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell suddenly on the theatre. The audience was standing. A woman
      sobbed somewhere in a far corner, but the rest were dismayed and
      speechless. A few steps before them all was Molly Mackinder, white and
      frightened, but in her eyes was a look of understanding as she gazed at
      Terry. Breathing hard, Terry stood still in the middle of the stage, the
      red fog not yet gone out of his eyes, his hands clasped at his side,
      vaguely realising the audience again. Behind him was the back curtain in
      which the lights of Orion twinkled aggressively. The three men who had
      attacked him were still where he had thrown them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was intense, the strain oppressive. But now a drawling voice
      came from the back of the hall. &ldquo;Are you watching the rise of Orion?&rdquo; it
      said. It was the voice of Gow Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain was broken; the audience dissolved in laughter; but it was not
      hilarious; it was the nervous laughter of relief, touched off by a native
      humour always present in the dweller of the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Terry quietly and abstractedly to the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the scene-shifter bethought himself and let down the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth act was not played that night. The people had had more than the
      worth of their money. In a few moments the stage was crowded with people
      from the audience, but both Jopp and O&rsquo;Ryan had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the visitors to the stage was Molly Mackinder. There was a meaning
      smile upon her face as she said to Dicky Fergus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was quite wonderful, wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;like a scene out of the classics&mdash;the
      gladiators or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus gave a wary smile as he answered: &ldquo;Yes. I felt like saying Ave
      Caesar, Ave! and I watched to see Artemis drop her handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She dropped it, but you were too busy to pick it up. It would have been a
      useful sling for your arm,&rdquo; she added with thoughtful malice. &ldquo;It seemed
      so real&mdash;you all acted so well, so appropriately. And how you keep it
      up!&rdquo; she added, as he cringed when some one knocked against his elbow,
      hurting the injured tendons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus looked at her meditatively before he answered. &ldquo;Oh, I think we&rsquo;ll
      likely keep it up for some time,&rdquo; he rejoined ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the play isn&rsquo;t finished?&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;There is another act? Yes, I
      thought there was, the programme said four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, there&rsquo;s another act,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t to be played
      now; and I&rsquo;m not in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose you are not in it. You really weren&rsquo;t in the last act. Who
      will be in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus suddenly laughed outright, as he looked at Holden expostulating
      intently to a crowd of people round him. &ldquo;Well, honour bright, I don&rsquo;t
      think there&rsquo;ll be anybody in it except little Conny Jopp and gentle Terry
      O&rsquo;Ryan; and Conny mayn&rsquo;t be in it very long. But he&rsquo;ll be in it for a
      while, I guess. You see, the curtain came down in the middle of a
      situation, not at the end of it. The curtain has to rise again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Orion will rise again&mdash;you think so?&rdquo; She laughed in satire;
      for Dicky Fergus had made love to her during the last three months with
      unsuppressed activity, and she knew him in his sentimental moments; which
      is fatal. It is fatal if, in a duet, one breathes fire and the other
      frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want my opinion,&rdquo; he said in a lower voice, as they moved towards
      the door, while people tried to listen to them&mdash;&ldquo;if you want it
      straight, I think Orion has risen&mdash;right up where shines the evening
      star&mdash;Oh, say, now,&rdquo; he broke off, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you had enough fun out of
      me? I tell you, it was touch and go. He nearly broke my arm&mdash;would
      have done it, if I hadn&rsquo;t gone limp to him; and your cousin Conny Jopp,
      little Conny Jopp, was as near Kingdom Come as a man wants at his age. I
      saw an elephant go &lsquo;must&rsquo; once in India, and it was as like O&rsquo;Ryan as
      putty is to dough. It isn&rsquo;t all over either, for O&rsquo;Ryan will forget and
      forgive, and Jopp won&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s your cousin, but he&rsquo;s a sulker. If he has to
      sit up nights to do it, he&rsquo;ll try to get back on O&rsquo;Ryan. He&rsquo;ll sit up
      nights, but he&rsquo;ll do it, if he can. And whatever it is, it won&rsquo;t be
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside the door they met Gow Johnson, excitement in his eyes. He heard
      Fergus&rsquo;s last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see Orion rising if he sits up nights,&rdquo; Gow Johnson said. &ldquo;The game
      is with Terry&mdash;at last.&rdquo; Then he called to the dispersing gossiping
      crowd: &ldquo;Hold on&mdash;hold on, you people. I&rsquo;ve got news for you. Folks,
      this is O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s night. It&rsquo;s his in the starry firmament. Look at him
      shine,&rdquo; he cried, stretching out his arm towards the heavens, where the
      glittering galaxy hung near the zenith. &ldquo;Terry O&rsquo;Ryan, our O&rsquo;Ryan&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      struck oil&mdash;on his ranch it&rsquo;s been struck. Old Vigon found it.
      Terry&rsquo;s got his own at last. O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s in it&mdash;in it alone. Now, let&rsquo;s
      hear the prairie-whisper,&rdquo; he shouted, in a great raucous voice. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
      hear the prairie-whisper. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd responded in a hoarse shout for O&rsquo;Ryan and his fortune. Even the
      women shouted&mdash;all except Molly Mackinder. She was wondering if
      O&rsquo;Ryan risen would be the same to her as O&rsquo;Ryan rising. She got into her
      carriage with a sigh, though she said to the few friends with her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s splendid. He deserves it too. Oh, I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      so glad.&rdquo; She laughed; but the laugh was a little hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was both glad and sorry. Yet as she drove home over the prairie she
      was silent. Far off in the east was a bright light. It was a bonfire built
      on O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s ranch, near where he had struck oil&mdash;struck it rich. The
      light grew and grew, and the prairie was alive with people hurrying
      towards it. La Touche should have had the news hours earlier, but the
      half-breed French-Canadian, Vigon, who had made the discovery, and had
      started for La Touche with the news, went suddenly off his head with
      excitement, and had ridden away into the prairie fiercely shouting his joy
      to an invisible world. The news had been brought in later by a farmhand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry O&rsquo;Ryan had really struck oil, and his ranch was a scene of decent
      revelry, of which Gow Johnson was master. But the central figure of it
      all, the man who had, in truth, risen like a star, had become to La Touche
      all at once its notoriety as well as its favourite, its great man as well
      as its friend, he was nowhere to be found. He had been seen riding full
      speed into the prairie towards the Kourmash Wood, and the starlit night
      had swallowed him. Constantine Jopp had also disappeared; but at first no
      one gave that thought or consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the night went on, however, a feeling began to stir which it is not
      good to rouse in frontier lands. It is sure to exhibit itself in forms
      more objective than are found in great populations where methods of
      punishment are various, and even when deadly are often refined. But
      society in new places has only limited resources, and is thrown back on
      primary ways and means. La Touche was no exception, and the keener
      spirits, to whom O&rsquo;Ryan had ever been &ldquo;a white man,&rdquo; and who so rejoiced
      in his good luck now that they drank his health a hundred times in his own
      whiskey and cider, were simmering with desire for a public reproval of
      Constantine Jopp&rsquo;s conduct. Though it was pointed out to them by the
      astute Gow Johnson that Fergus and Holden had participated in the colossal
      joke of the play, they had learned indirectly also the whole truth
      concerning the past of the two men. They realised that Fergus and Holden
      had been duped by Jopp into the escapade. Their primitive sense of justice
      exonerated the humourists and arraigned the one malicious man. As the
      night wore on they decided on the punishment to be meted out by La Touche
      to the man who had not &ldquo;acted on the square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gow Johnson saw, too late, that he had roused a spirit as hard to appease
      as the demon roused in O&rsquo;Ryan earlier in the evening. He would have
      enjoyed the battue of punishment under ordinary circumstances; but he knew
      that Miss Molly Mackinder would be humiliated and indignant at the
      half-savage penalty they meant to exact. He had determined that O&rsquo;Ryan
      should marry her; and this might be an obstruction in the path. It was
      true that O&rsquo;Ryan now would be a rich man&mdash;one of the richest in the
      West, unless all signs failed; but meanwhile a union of fortunes would
      only be an added benefit. Besides, he had seen that O&rsquo;Ryan was in earnest,
      and what O&rsquo;Ryan wanted he himself wanted even more strongly. He was not
      concerned greatly for O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s absence. He guessed that Terry had ridden
      away into the night to work off the dark spirit that was on him, to have
      it out with himself. Gow Johnson was a philosopher. He was twenty years
      older than O&rsquo;Ryan, and he had studied his friend as a pious monk his
      missal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right in his judgment. When Terry left the theatre he was like one
      in a dream, every nerve in his body at tension, his head aflame, his
      pulses throbbing. For miles he rode away into the waste along the northern
      trail, ever away from La Touche and his own home. He did not know of the
      great good fortune that had come to him; and if, in this hour, he had
      known, he would not have cared. As he rode on and on remorse drew him into
      its grasp. Shame seized him that he had let passion be his master, that he
      had lost his self-control, had taken a revenge out of all proportion to
      the injury and insult to himself. It did not ease his mind that he knew
      Constantine Jopp had done the thing out of meanness and malice; for he was
      alive to-night in the light of the stars, with the sweet crisp air blowing
      in his face, because of an act of courage on the part of his schooldays&rsquo; 
      foe. He remembered now that, when he was drowning, he had clung to Jopp
      with frenzied arms and had endangered the bully&rsquo;s life also. The long
      torture of owing this debt to so mean a soul was on him still, was rooted
      in him; but suddenly, in the silent searching night, some spirit whispered
      in his ear that this was the price which he must pay for his life saved to
      the world, a compromise with the Inexorable Thing. On the verge of
      oblivion and the end, he had been snatched back by relenting Fate, which
      requires something for something given, when laws are overridden and doom
      defeated. Yes, the price he was meant to pay was gratitude to one of
      shrivelled soul and innate antipathy; and he had not been man enough to
      see the trial through to the end! With a little increased strain put upon
      his vanity and pride he had run amuck. Like some heathen gladiator he had
      ravaged in the ring. He had gone down into the basements of human life and
      there made a cockpit for his animal rage, till, in the contest, brain and
      intellect had been saturated by the fumes and sweat of fleshly fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      How quiet the night was, how soothing to the fevered mind and body, how
      the cool air laved the heated head and flushed the lungs of the rheum of
      passion! He rode on and on, farther and farther away from home, his back
      upon the scenes where his daily deeds were done. It was long past midnight
      before he turned his horse&rsquo;s head again homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buried in his thoughts, now calm and determined, with a new life grown up
      in him, a new strength different from the mastering force which gave him a
      strength in the theatre like one in delirium, he noticed nothing. He was
      only conscious of the omniscient night and its warm penetrating
      friendliness; as, in a great trouble, when no words can be spoken, a cool
      kind palm steals into the trembling hand of misery and stills it, gives it
      strength and life and an even pulse. He was now master in the house of his
      soul, and had no fear or doubt as to the future, or as to his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first duty was to go to Constantine Jopp, and speak his regret like a
      man. And after that it would be his duty to carry a double debt his life
      long for the life saved, for the wrong done. He owed an apology to La
      Touche, and he was scarcely aware that the native gentlemanliness in him
      had said through his fever of passion over the footlights: &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon.&rdquo; In his heart he felt that he had offered a mean affront to every
      person present, to the town where his interests lay, where his heart lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where his heart lay&mdash;Molly Mackinder! He knew now that vanity had
      something to do, if not all to do, with his violent acts, and though there
      suddenly shot through his mind, as he rode back, a savage thrill at the
      remembrance of how he had handled the three, it was only a passing
      emotion. He was bent on putting himself right with Jopp and with La
      Touche. With the former his way was clear; he did not yet see his way as
      to La Touche. How would he be able to make the amende honorable to La
      Touche?
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he became somewhat less absorbed and enveloped by the comforting
      night. He saw the glimmer of red light afar, and vaguely wondered what it
      was. It was in the direction of O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s Ranch, but he thought nothing of
      it, because it burned steadily. It was probably a fire lighted by settlers
      trailing to the farther north. While the night wore on he rode as slowly
      back to the town as he had galloped from it like a centaur with a captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again Molly Mackinder&rsquo;s face came before him; but he resolutely
      shut it out of his thoughts. He felt that he had no right to think of her
      until he had &ldquo;done the right thing&rdquo; by Jopp and by La Touche. Yet the look
      in her face as the curtain came down, it was not that of one indifferent
      to him or to what he did. He neared the town half-way between midnight and
      morning. Almost unconsciously avoiding the main streets, he rode a
      roundabout way towards the little house where Constantine Jopp lived. He
      could hear loud noises in the streets, singing, and hoarse shouts. Then
      silence came, then shouts, and silence again. It was all quiet as he rode
      up to Jopp&rsquo;s house, standing on the outskirts of the town. There was a
      bright light in the window of a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jopp, then, was still up. He would not wait till tomorrow. He would do the
      right thing now. He would put things straight with his foe before he
      slept; he would do it at any sacrifice to his pride. He had conquered his
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted, threw the bridle over a post, and, going into the garden,
      knocked gently at the door. There was no response. He knocked again, and
      listened intently. Now he heard a sound-like a smothered cry or groan. He
      opened the door quickly and entered. It was dark. In another room beyond
      was a light. From it came the same sound he had heard before, but louder;
      also there was a shuffling footstep. Springing forward to the half-open
      door, he pushed it wide, and met the terror-stricken eyes of Constantine
      Jopp&mdash;the same look that he had seen at the theatre when his hands
      were on Jopp&rsquo;s throat, but more ghastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jopp was bound to a chair by a lasso. Both arms were fastened to the
      chair-arm, and beneath them, on the floor, were bowls into which blood
      dripped from his punctured wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly taken it all in&mdash;the work of an instant&mdash;when he
      saw crouched in a corner, madness in his eyes, his half-breed Vigon. He
      grasped the situation in a flash. Vigon had gone mad, had lain in wait in
      Jopp&rsquo;s house, and when the man he hated had seated himself in the chair,
      had lassoed him, bound him, and was slowly bleeding him to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no time to think. Before he could act Vigon was upon him also,
      frenzy in his eyes, a knife clutched in his hand. Reason had fled, and he
      only saw in O&rsquo;Ryan the frustrator of his revenge. He had watched the drip,
      drip from his victim&rsquo;s wrists with a dreadful joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were man and man, but O&rsquo;Ryan found in this grisly contest a vaster
      trial of strength than in the fight upon the stage a few hours ago. The
      first lunge that Vigon made struck him on the tip of the shoulder, and
      drew blood; but he caught the hand holding the knife in an iron grasp,
      while the half-breed, with superhuman strength, tried in vain for the long
      brown throat of the man for whom he had struck oil. As they struggled and
      twisted, the eyes of the victim in the chair watched them with agonised
      emotions. For him it was life or death. He could not cry out&mdash;his
      mouth was gagged; but to O&rsquo;Ryan his groans were like a distant echo of his
      own hoarse gasps as he fought his desperate fight. Terry was as one in an
      awful dream battling with vague impersonal powers which slowly strangled
      his life, yet held him back in torture from the final surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      For minutes they struggled. At last O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s strength came to the point of
      breaking, for Vigon was a powerful man, and to this was added a madman&rsquo;s
      energy. He felt that the end was coming. But all at once, through the
      groans of the victim in the chair, Terry became conscious of noises
      outside&mdash;such noises as he had heard before he entered the house,
      only nearer and louder. At the same time he heard a horse&rsquo;s hoofs, then a
      knock at the door, and a voice calling: &ldquo;Jopp! Jopp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a last desperate struggle, and shouted hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later there were footsteps in the room, followed by a cry of
      fright and amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Gow Johnson. He had come to warn Constantine Jopp that a crowd were
      come to tar and feather him, and to get him away on his own horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he sprang to the front door, called to the approaching crowd for help,
      then ran back to help O&rsquo;Ryan. A moment later a dozen men had Vigon secure,
      and had released Constantine Jopp, now almost dead from loss of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they took the gag from his mouth and tied their handkerchiefs round his
      bleeding wrists, Jopp sobbed aloud. His eyes were fixed on Terry O&rsquo;Ryan.
      Terry met the look, and grasped the limp hand lying on the chair-arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, O&rsquo;Ryan, I&rsquo;m sorry for all I&rsquo;ve done to you,&rdquo; Jopp sobbed. &ldquo;I
      was a sneak, but I want to own it. I want to be square now. You can tar
      and feather me, if you like. I deserve it.&rdquo; He looked at the others. &ldquo;I
      deserve it,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the boys had thought would be appropriate,&rdquo; said Gow Johnson
      with a dry chuckle, and the crowd looked at each other and winked. The
      wink was kindly, however. &ldquo;To own up and take your gruel&rdquo; was the easiest
      way to touch the men of the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later the roisterers, who had meant to carry Constantine Jopp
      on a rail, carried Terry O&rsquo;Ryan on their shoulders through the town,
      against his will. As they passed the house where Miss Mackinder lived some
      one shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you watching the rise of Orion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many a time thereafter Terry O&rsquo;Ryan and Molly Mackinder looked at the
      galaxy in the evening sky with laughter and with pride. It had played its
      part with Fate against Constantine Jopp and the little widow at Jansen. It
      had never shone so brightly as on the night when Vigon struck oil on
      O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s ranch. But Vigon had no memory of that. Such is the irony of
      life.

    <h2>
      THE ERROR OF THE DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Error of the Day&rdquo; may be defined as &ldquo;The difference between the
      distance or range which must be put upon the sights in order to hit the
      target and the actual distance from the gun to the target.&rdquo;&mdash;Admiralty
      Note.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great naval gun never fires twice alike. It varies from day to day, and
      expert allowance has to be made in sighting every time it is fired.
      Variations in atmosphere, condition of ammunition, and the wear of the gun
      are the contributory causes to the ever-varying &ldquo;Error of the Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         .........................
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t he pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jim-dandy-oh, my!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his price in the open market?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty millions-I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then was heard the voice of Billy Goat&mdash;his name was William Goatry
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Out in the cold world, out in the street;
        Nothing to wear, and nothing to eat,
        Fatherless, motherless, sadly I roam,
        Child of misfortune, I&rsquo;m driven from home.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A loud laugh followed, for Billy Goat was a popular person at Kowatin in
      the Saskatchewan country. He had an inimitable drollery, heightened by a
      cast in his eye, a very large mouth, and a round, good-humoured face; also
      he had a hand and arm like iron, and was altogether a great man on a
      &ldquo;spree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been a two days&rsquo; spree at Kowatin, for no other reason than that
      there had been great excitement over the capture and the subsequent escape
      of a prairie-rover, who had robbed the contractor&rsquo;s money-chest at the
      rail-head on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. Forty miles from Kowatin he
      had been caught by, and escaped from, the tall, brown-eyed man with the
      hard-bitten face who leaned against the open window of the tavern, looking
      indifferently at the jeering crowd before him. For a police officer he was
      not unpopular with them, but he had been a failure for once, and, as Billy
      Goat had said: &ldquo;It tickled us to death to see a rider of the plains off
      his trolley&mdash;on the cold, cold ground, same as you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not undervalue him. If he had been less a man than he was, they
      would not have taken the trouble to cover him with their drunken ribaldry.
      He had scored off them in the past in just such sprees as this, when he
      had the power to do so, and used the power good-naturedly and quietly&mdash;but
      used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he was Sergeant Foyle of the Royal North-West Mounted Police, on
      duty in a district as large as the United Kingdom. And he had no greater
      admirer than Billy Goat, who now reviled him. Not without cause, in a way,
      for he had reviled himself to this extent, that when the prairie-rover,
      Halbeck, escaped on the way to Prince Albert, after six months&rsquo; hunt for
      him and a final capture in the Kowatin district, Foyle resigned the Force
      before the Commissioner could reproach him or call him to account. Usually
      so exact, so certain of his target, some care had not been taken, he had
      miscalculated, and there had been the Error of the Day. Whatever it was,
      it had seemed to him fatal; and he had turned his face from the barrack
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he had made his way to the Happy Land Hotel at Kowatin, to begin life
      as &ldquo;a free and independent gent on the loose,&rdquo; as Billy Goat had said. To
      resign had seemed extreme; because, though the Commissioner was vexed at
      Halbeck&rsquo;s escape, Foyle was the best non-commissioned officer in the
      Force. He had frightened horse thieves and bogus land-agents and
      speculators out of the country; had fearlessly tracked down a criminal or
      a band of criminals when the odds were heavy against him. He carried on
      his cheek the scars of two bullets, and there was one white lock in his
      brown hair, where an arrow had torn the scalp away as, alone, he drove
      into the Post a score of Indians, fresh from raiding the cattle of an
      immigrant trailing north.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was out of work, or so it seemed; he had stepped down from his
      scarlet-coated dignity, from the place of guardian and guide of
      civilisation, into the idleness of a tavern stoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the little group swayed round him, and Billy Goat started another song,
      Foyle roused himself as though to move away&mdash;he was waiting for the
      mail-stage to take him south:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, father, dear father, come home with me now,
     The clock in the steeple strikes one;
     You said you were coming right home from the shop
     As soon as your day&rsquo;s work was done.
     Come home&mdash;come home&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The song arrested him, and he leaned back against the window again. A
      curious look came into his eyes, a look that had nothing to do with the
      acts of the people before him. It was searching into a scene beyond this
      bright sunlight and the far green-brown grass, and the little oasis of
      trees in the distance marking a homestead and the dust of the
      wagon-wheels, out on the trail beyond the grain-elevator-beyond the blue
      horizon&rsquo;s rim, quivering in the heat, and into regions where this crisp,
      clear, life-giving, life-saving air never blew.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;You said you were coming right home from the shop
     As soon as your day&rsquo;s work was done.
     Come home&mdash;come home&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He remembered when he had first heard this song in a play called &lsquo;Ten
      Nights in a Bar-room&rsquo;, many years before, and how it had wrenched his
      heart and soul, and covered him with a sudden cloud of shame and anger.
      For his father had been a drunkard, and his brother had grown up a
      drunkard, that brother whom he had not seen for ten years until&mdash;until&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered, closed his eyes, as though to shut out something that the
      mind saw. He had had a rough life, he had become inured to the seamy side
      of things&mdash;there was a seamy side even in this clean, free, wide
      land; and he had no sentimentality; though something seemed to hurt and
      shame him now.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;As soon as your day&rsquo;s work was done.
     Come home&mdash;come home&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The crowd was uproarious. The exhilaration had become a kind of delirium.
      Men were losing their heads; there was an element of irresponsibility in
      the new outbreak likely to breed some violent act, which every man of them
      would lament when sober again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nettlewood Foyle watched the dust rising from the wheels of the stage,
      which had passed the elevator and was nearing the Prairie Home Hotel far
      down the street. He would soon leave behind him this noisy ribaldry of
      which he was the centre. He tossed his cheroot away. Suddenly he heard a
      low voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you hit out, sergeant?&rdquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started almost violently, and turned round. Then his face flushed, his
      eyes blurred with feeling and deep surprise, and his lips parted in a
      whispered exclamation and greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl&rsquo;s face from the shade of the sitting-room was looking out at him,
      half-smiling, but with heightened colour and a suppressed agitation. The
      girl was not more than twenty-five, graceful, supple, and strong. Her chin
      was dimpled; across her right temple was a slight scar. She had eyes of a
      wonderful deep blue; they seemed to swim with light. As Foyle gazed at her
      for a moment dumfounded, with a quizzical suggestion and smiling still a
      little more, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to be a little quicker, Nett.&rdquo; The voice appeared to attempt
      unconcern; but it quivered from a force of feeling underneath. It was so
      long since she had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to reply, but, at the instant, a reveller pushed him with a
      foot behind the knees so that they were sprung forward. The crowd laughed&mdash;all
      save Billy Goat, who knew his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like lightning, and with cold fury in his eyes, Foyle caught the tall
      cattleman by the forearm, and, with a swift, dexterous twist, had the
      fellow in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down&mdash;down, to your knees, you skunk,&rdquo; he said in a low, fierce
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knees of the big man bent,&mdash;Foyle had not taken lessons of Ogami,
      the Jap, for nothing&mdash;they bent, and the cattleman squealed, so
      intense was the pain. It was break or bend; and he bent&mdash;to the
      ground and lay there. Foyle stood over him for a moment, a hard light in
      his eyes, and then, as if bethinking himself, he looked at the other
      roisterers, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a limit, and he reached it. Your mouths are your own, and you can
      blow off to suit your fancy, but if any one thinks I&rsquo;m a tame coyote to be
      poked with a stick&mdash;!&rdquo; He broke off, stooped over, and helped the man
      before him to his feet. The arm had been strained, and the big fellow
      nursed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell, but you&rsquo;re a twister!&rdquo; the cattleman said with a grimace of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Goat was a gentleman, after his kind, and he liked Sergeant Foyle
      with a great liking. He turned to the crowd and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, boys, this mine&rsquo;s worked out. Let&rsquo;s leave the Happy Land to Foyle.
      Boys, what is he&mdash;what&mdash;is he? What&mdash;is&mdash;Sergeant
      Foyle&mdash;boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roar of the song they all knew came in reply, as Billy Goat waved his
      arms about like the wild leader of a wild orchestra:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Sergeant Foyle, oh, he&rsquo;s a knocker from the West,
     He&rsquo;s a chase-me-Charley, come-and-kiss-me tiger from the zoo;
     He&rsquo;s a dandy on the pinch, and he&rsquo;s got a double cinch
     On the gent that&rsquo;s going careless, and he&rsquo;ll soon cinch you:
     And he&rsquo;ll soon&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll soon&mdash;cinch you!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Foyle watched them go, dancing, stumbling, calling back at him, as they
      moved towards the Prairie Home Hotel:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll soon-and he&rsquo;ll soon-cinch you!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His under lip came out, his eyes half-closed, as he watched them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      done my last cinch. I&rsquo;ve done my last cinch,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, the look in his face changed, the eyes swam as they had
      done a minute before at the sight of the girl in the room behind. Whatever
      his trouble was, that face had obscured it in a flash, and the pools of
      feeling far down in the depths of a lonely nature had been stirred.
      Recognition, memory, tenderness, desire swam in his face, made generous
      and kind the hard lines of the strong mouth. In an instant he had swung
      himself over the window-sill. The girl had drawn away now into a more
      shaded corner of the room, and she regarded him with a mingled anxiety and
      eagerness. Was she afraid of something? Did she fear that&mdash;she knew
      not quite what, but it had to do with a long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was time you hit out, Nett,&rdquo; she said, half shyly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re more
      patient than you used to be, but you&rsquo;re surer. My, that was a twist you
      gave him, Nett. Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo; she added hastily, and with an
      effort to hide her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out and took her hand with a strange shyness, and a
      self-consciousness which was alien to his nature. The touch of her hand
      thrilled him. Their eyes met. She dropped hers. Then he gathered him self
      together. &ldquo;Glad to see you? Of course, of course, I&rsquo;m glad. You stunned
      me, Jo. Why, do you know where you are? You&rsquo;re a thousand miles from home.
      I can&rsquo;t get it through my head, not really. What brings you here? It&rsquo;s ten
      years&mdash;ten years since I saw you, and you were only fifteen, but a
      fifteen that was as good as twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scanned her face closely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that scar on your forehead, Jo? You
      hadn&rsquo;t that&mdash;then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran up against something,&rdquo; she said evasively, her eyes glittering,
      &ldquo;and it left that scar. Does it look so bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;d never notice it, if you weren&rsquo;t looking close as I am. You see,
      I knew your face so well ten years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head with a forced kind of smile. It became him, however, for
      he smiled rarely; and the smile was like a lantern turned on his face; it
      gave light and warmth to its quiet strength-or hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were always quizzing,&rdquo; she said with an attempt at a laugh&mdash;&ldquo;always
      trying to find out things. That&rsquo;s why you made them reckon with you out
      here. You always could see behind things; always would have your own way;
      always were meant to be a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to get control of herself again, was trying hard to keep
      things on the surface. &ldquo;You were meant to succeed&mdash;you had to,&rdquo; she
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a failure&mdash;a dead failure,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;So they
      say. So they said. You heard them, Jo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked his head towards the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those drunken fools!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly, and her face
      hardened. &ldquo;How I hate drink! It spoils everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. They were both thinking of the same thing&mdash;of
      the same man. He repeated a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings you out here, Jo?&rdquo; he asked gently. &ldquo;Dorland,&rdquo; she answered,
      her face setting into determination and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face became pinched. &ldquo;Dorl!&rdquo; he said heavily. &ldquo;What for, Jo? What do
      you want with Dorl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Cynthy died she left her five hundred dollars a year to the baby,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Well, Jo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was all right for five years&mdash;Dorland paid it in; but for
      five years he hasn&rsquo;t paid anything. He&rsquo;s taken it, stolen it from his own
      child by his own honest wife. I&rsquo;ve come to get it&mdash;anyway, to stop
      him from doing it any more. His own child&mdash;it puts murder in my
      heart, Nett! I could kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded grimly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s likely. And you&rsquo;ve kept, Dorl&rsquo;s child with your
      own money all these years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got four hundred dollars a year, Nett, you know; and I&rsquo;ve been
      dressmaking&mdash;they say I&rsquo;ve got taste,&rdquo; she added, with a whimsical
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nett nodded his head. &ldquo;Five years. That&rsquo;s twenty-five hundred dollars he&rsquo;s
      stolen from his own child. It&rsquo;s eight years old now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby is eight and a half,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his schooling, and his clothing, and everything; and you have to pay
      for it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind, Nett, it isn&rsquo;t that. Bobby is Cynthy&rsquo;s child; and I
      love him&mdash;love him; but I want him to have his rights. Dorl must give
      up his hold on that money&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded gravely. &ldquo;Or you&rsquo;ll set the law on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing or the other. Better to do it now when Bobby is young and
      can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or read the newspapers,&rdquo; he commented thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve a hard heart,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to punish
      him, if it wasn&rsquo;t that he&rsquo;s your brother, Nett; and if it wasn&rsquo;t for
      Bobby. Dorland was dreadfully cruel, even to Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know he was up here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;From the lawyer that pays
      over the money. Dorland has had it sent out here to Kowatin this two
      years. And he sent word to the lawyer a month ago that he wanted it to get
      here as usual. The letter left the same day as I did, and it got here
      yesterday with me, I suppose. He&rsquo;ll be after it-perhaps to-day. He
      wouldn&rsquo;t let it wait long, Dorl wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foyle started. &ldquo;To-day&mdash;to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a gleam in his eyes, a setting of the lips, a line sinking into
      the forehead between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching for him all day, and I&rsquo;ll watch till he comes. I&rsquo;m
      going to say some things to him that he won&rsquo;t forget. I&rsquo;m going to get
      Bobby&rsquo;s money, or have the law do it&mdash;unless you think I&rsquo;m a brute,
      Nett.&rdquo; She looked at him wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t worry about me, Jo. He&rsquo;s my brother, but I know
      him&mdash;I know him through and through. He&rsquo;s done everything that a man
      can do and not be hanged. A thief, a drunkard, and a brute&mdash;and he
      killed a man out here,&rdquo; he added hoarsely. &ldquo;I found it out myself&mdash;myself.
      It was murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as he looked at her, an idea seemed to flash into his mind. He
      came very near and looked at her closely. Then he reached over and almost
      touched the scar on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he do that, Jo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she was silent and looked down at the floor. Presently she
      raised her eyes, her face suffused. Once or twice she tried to speak, but
      failed. At last she gained courage and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After Cynthy&rsquo;s death I kept house for him for a year, taking care of
      little Bobby. I loved Bobby so&mdash;he has Cynthy&rsquo;s eyes. One day Dorland&mdash;oh,
      Nett, of course I oughtn&rsquo;t to have stayed there, I know it now; but I was
      only sixteen, and what did I understand! And my mother was dead. One day&mdash;oh,
      please, Nett, you can guess. He said something to me. I made him leave the
      house. Before I could make plans what to do, he came back mad with drink.
      I went for Bobby, to get out of the house, but he caught hold of me. I
      struck him in the face, and he threw me against the edge of the open door.
      It made the scar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foyle&rsquo;s face was white. &ldquo;Why did you never write and tell me that, Jo? You
      know that I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had gone out of our lives down there. I didn&rsquo;t know where you were
      for a long time; and then&mdash;then it was all right about Bobby and me,
      except that Bobby didn&rsquo;t get the money that was his. But now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foyle&rsquo;s voice was hoarse and low. &ldquo;He made that scar, and he&mdash;and you
      only sixteen&mdash;Oh, my God!&rdquo; Suddenly his face reddened, and he choked
      with shame and anger. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s my brother!&rdquo; was all that he could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see him up here ever?&rdquo; she asked pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw him till a week ago.&rdquo; A moment, then he added: &ldquo;The letter
      wasn&rsquo;t to be sent here in his own name, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, in his own name, Dorland W. Foyle. Didn&rsquo;t he go by that
      name when you saw him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an oppressive silence, in which she saw that something moved him
      strangely, and then he answered: &ldquo;No, he was going by the name of Halbeck&mdash;Hiram
      Halbeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gasped. Then the whole thing burst upon her. &ldquo;Hiram Halbeck!
      Hiram Halbeck, the thief&mdash;I read it all in the papers&mdash;the thief
      that you caught, and that got away. And you&rsquo;ve left the Mounted Police
      because of it&mdash;oh, Nett!&rdquo; Her eyes were full of tears, her face was
      drawn and grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who he was till I arrested him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then,
      afterward, I thought of his child, and let him get away; and for my poor
      old mother&rsquo;s sake. She never knew how bad he was even as a boy. But I
      remember how he used to steal and drink the brandy from her bedside, when
      she had the fever. She never knew the worst of him. But I let him away in
      the night, Jo, and I resigned, and they thought that Halbeck had beaten
      me, had escaped. Of course I couldn&rsquo;t stay in the Force, having done that.
      But, by the heaven above us, if I had him here now, I&rsquo;d do the thing&mdash;do
      it, so help me God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you ruin your life for him?&rdquo; she said, with an outburst of
      indignation. All that was in her heart welled up in her eyes at the
      thought of what Foyle was. &ldquo;You must not do it. You shall not do it. He
      must pay for his wickedness, not you. It would be a sin. You and what
      becomes of you mean so much.&rdquo; Suddenly with a flash of purpose she added:
      &ldquo;He will come for that letter, Nett. He would run any kind of risk to get
      a dollar. He will come here for that letter&mdash;perhaps today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head moodily, oppressed by the trouble that was on him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      not likely to venture here, after what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him as well as I do, Nett. He is so vain he&rsquo;d do it, just
      to show that he could. He&rsquo;d&rsquo; probably come in the evening. Does any one
      know him here? So many people pass through Kowatin every day. Has any one
      seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Billy Goatry,&rdquo; he answered, working his way to a solution of the
      dark problem. &ldquo;Only Billy Goatry knows him. The fellow that led the
      singing&mdash;that was Goatry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; he added, as Billy Goat passed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to settle things with
      him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If Dorl comes, Nett&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, then he caught her hand in his and held
      it. &ldquo;If he comes, leave him to me, Jo. You will leave him to me?&rdquo; he added
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s right-by Bobby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by Dorl, too,&rdquo; he replied strangely. There were loud footsteps
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Goatry,&rdquo; said Foyle. &ldquo;You stay here. I&rsquo;ll tell him everything. He&rsquo;s
      all right; he&rsquo;s a true friend. He&rsquo;ll not interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The handle of the door turned slowly. &ldquo;You keep watch on the post-office,
      Jo,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goatry came round the opening door with a grin. &ldquo;Hope I don&rsquo;t intrude,&rdquo; he
      said, stealing a half-leering look at the girl. As soon as he saw her
      face, however, he straightened himself up and took on different manners.
      He had not been so intoxicated as he had made, out, and he seemed only
      &ldquo;mellow&rdquo; as he stood before them, with his corrugated face and queer,
      quaint look, the eye with the cast in it blinking faster than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Goatry,&rdquo; said Foyle. &ldquo;This lady is, one of my family from
      the East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; on by stage?&rdquo; Goatry said vaguely, as they shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, for she was looking down the street, and presently she
      started as she gazed. She laid a hand suddenly on Foyle&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See&mdash;he&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, and as though not realising
      Goatry&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goatry looked as well as Foyle. &ldquo;Halbeck&mdash;the devil!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foyle turned to him. &ldquo;Stand by, Goatry. I want you to keep a shut mouth.
      I&rsquo;ve work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goatry held out his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you. If you get him this time, clamp
      him, clamp him like a tooth in a harrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halbeck had stopped his horse at the post-office door. Dismounting he
      looked quickly round, then drew the reins over the horse&rsquo;s head, letting
      them trail, as is the custom of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few swift words passed between Goatry and Foyle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do this myself,
      Jo,&rdquo; he whispered to the girl presently. &ldquo;Go into another room. I&rsquo;ll bring
      him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute Goatry was leading the horse away from the post-office,
      while Foyle stood waiting quietly at the door. The departing footsteps of
      the horse brought Halbeck swiftly to the doorway, with a letter in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there, you damned sucker!&rdquo; he called after Goatry, and then saw Foyle
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the hell&mdash;!&rdquo; he said fiercely, his hand on something in his hip
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet, Dorl. I want to have a little talk with you. Take your hand
      away from that gun&mdash;take it away,&rdquo; he added with a meaning not to be
      misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halbeck knew that one shout would have the town on him, and he did not
      know what card his brother was going to play. He let his arm drop to his
      side. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game? What do you want?&rdquo; he asked surlily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over to the Happy Land Hotel,&rdquo; Foyle answered, and in the light of
      what was in his mind his words had a grim irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a snarl Halbeck stepped out. Goatry, who had handed the horse over to
      the hostler, watched them coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I never notice the likeness before?&rdquo; Goatry said to himself.
      &ldquo;But, gosh! what a difference in the men. Foyle&rsquo;s going to double cinch
      him this time, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed them inside the hall of the Happy Land. When they stepped into
      the sitting-room, he stood at the door waiting. The hotel was entirely
      empty, the roisterers at the Prairie Home having drawn off the idlers and
      spectators. The barman was nodding behind the bar, the proprietor was
      moving about in the backyard inspecting a horse. There was a cheerful
      warmth everywhere, the air was like an elixir, the pungent smell of a
      pine-tree at the door gave a kind of medicament to the indrawn breath. And
      to Billy Goat, who sometimes sang in the choir of a church not a hundred
      miles away&mdash;for people agreed to forget his occasional sprees&mdash;there
      came, he knew not why, the words of a hymn he had sung only the preceding
      Sunday:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;As pants the hart for cooling streams,
        When heated in the chase&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The words kept ringing in his ears as he listened to the conversation
      inside the room&mdash;the partition was thin, the door thinner, and he
      heard much. Foyle had asked him not to intervene, but only to stand by and
      await the issue of this final conference. He meant, however, to take a
      hand in, if he thought he was needed, and he kept his ear glued to the
      door. If he thought Foyle needed him&mdash;his fingers were on the handle
      of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, hurry up! What do you want with me?&rdquo; asked Halbeck of his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; said ex-Sergeant Foyle, as he drew the blind
      three-quarters down, so that they could not be seen from the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry, I tell you. I&rsquo;ve got my plans. I&rsquo;m going South. I&rsquo;ve only
      just time to catch the Canadian Pacific three days from now, riding hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going South, Dorl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I going, then?&rdquo; was the sneering reply. &ldquo;Not farther than the
      Happy Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s all this? You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re trying to arrest me
      again, after letting me go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to ask. You&rsquo;re my prisoner. You&rsquo;re my prisoner,&rdquo; he said
      in a louder voice&mdash;&ldquo;until you free yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that damn quick, then,&rdquo; said the other, his hand flying to his
      hip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; was the sharp rejoinder, and a pistol was in his face before
      he could draw his own weapon. &ldquo;Put your gun on the table,&rdquo; Foyle said
      quietly. Halbeck did so. There was no other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foyle drew it over to himself. His brother made a motion to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still, Dorl,&rdquo; came the warning voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      White with rage, the freebooter sat still, his dissipated face and heavy
      angry lips looking like a debauched and villainous caricature of his
      brother before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose you&rsquo;d have potted me, Dorl,&rdquo; said the ex-sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have thought no more of doing that than you did of killing Linley,
      the ranchman; than you did of trying to ruin Jo Byndon, your wife&rsquo;s
      sister, when she was sixteen years old, when she was caring for your child&mdash;giving
      her life for the child you brought into the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of hell&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bluster. I know the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you-the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did&mdash;to-day&mdash;an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She here&mdash;out here?&rdquo; There was a new cowed note in the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she come here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make you do right by your own child. I wonder what a jury of decent
      men would think about a man who robbed his child for five years, and let
      that child be fed and clothed and cared for by the girl he tried to
      destroy, the girl he taught what sin there was in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She put you up to this. She was always in love with you, and you know
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dangerous look in Foyle&rsquo;s eyes, and his jaw set hard. &ldquo;There
      would be no shame in a decent woman caring for me, even if it was true. I
      haven&rsquo;t put myself outside the boundary as you have. You&rsquo;re my brother,
      but you&rsquo;re the worst scoundrel in the country&mdash;the worst unhanged.
      Put on the table there the letter in your pocket. It holds five hundred
      dollars belonging to your child. There&rsquo;s twenty-five hundred dollars more
      to be accounted for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other hesitated, then with an oath threw the letter on the table.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay the rest as soon as I can, if you&rsquo;ll stop this damned
      tomfoolery,&rdquo; he said sullenly, for he saw that he was in a hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay it, I suppose, out of what you stole from the C.P.R.
      contractor&rsquo;s chest. No, I don&rsquo;t think that will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to go to prison, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. The truth would come out at the trial&mdash;the whole truth&mdash;the
      murder, and all. There&rsquo;s your child Bobby. You&rsquo;ve done him enough wrong
      already. Do you want him&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you do or not&mdash;do
      you want him to carry through life the fact that his father was a
      jail-bird and a murderer, just as Jo Byndon carries the scar you made when
      you threw her against the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me, then?&rdquo; The man sank slowly and heavily back
      into the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a way&mdash;have you never thought of it? When you threatened
      others as you did me, and life seemed such a little thing in others&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered, the man looked around helplessly. In the silence which
      followed Foyle&rsquo;s words his brain was struggling to see a way out. Foyle&rsquo;s
      further words seemed to come from a great distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late to do the decent thing. You&rsquo;ll never repent of all
      you&rsquo;ve done; you&rsquo;ll never do different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old reckless, irresponsible spirit revived in the man; he had both
      courage and bravado, he was not hopeless yet of finding an escape from the
      net. He would not beg, he would struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived as I meant to, and I&rsquo;m not going to snivel or repent now. It&rsquo;s
      all a rotten business, anyhow,&rdquo; he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden resolution the ex-sergeant put his own pistol in his pocket,
      then pushed Halbeck&rsquo;s pistol over towards him on the table. Halbeck&rsquo;s eyes
      lighted eagerly, grew red with excitement, then a change passed over them.
      They now settled on the pistol, and stayed. He heard Foyle&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      with you to do what you ought to do. Of course you can kill me. My
      pistol&rsquo;s in my pocket. But I don&rsquo;t think you will. You&rsquo;ve murdered one
      man. You won&rsquo;t load your soul up with another. Besides, if you kill me,
      you will never get away from Kowatin alive. But it&rsquo;s with you&mdash;take
      your choice. It&rsquo;s me or you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halbeck&rsquo;s fingers crept out and found the pistol. &ldquo;Do your duty, Dorl,&rdquo;
       said the ex-sergeant as he turned his back on his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room opened, and Goatry stepped inside softly. He had work
      to do, if need be, and his face showed it. Halbeck did not see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a demon in Halbeck&rsquo;s eyes, as his brother stood, his back
      turned, taking his chances. A large mirror hung on the wall opposite
      Halbeck. Goatry was watching Halbeck&rsquo;s face in the glass, and saw the
      danger. He measured his distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Halbeck caught Goatry&rsquo;s face in the mirror. The dark devilry
      faded out of his eyes. His lips moved in a whispered oath. Every way was
      blocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden wild resolution he raised the pistol to his head. It
      cracked, and he fell back heavily in the chair. There was a red trickle at
      the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had chosen the best way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had the pluck,&rdquo; said Goatry, as Foyle swung round with a face of
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterward came a rush of people. Goatry kept them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant Foyle arrested Halbeck, and Halbeck&rsquo;s shot himself,&rdquo; Goatry
      explained to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white-faced girl with a scar on her temple made her way into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away-come away, Jo,&rdquo; said the voice of the man she loved; and he did
      not let her see the lifeless figure in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later the plains swallowed them, as they made their way with
      Billy Goatry to the headquarters of the Riders of the Plains, where
      Sergeant Foyle was asked to reconsider his resignation: which he did.

      THE WHISPERER
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;And thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground,
   and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be
   as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground, and thy
   speech shall whisper out of the dust.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The harvest was all in, and, as far as eye could observe nothing remained
      of the golden sea of wheat which had covered the wide prairie save the
      yellow stubble, the bed of an ocean of wealth which had been gathered.
      Here, the yellow level was broken by a dark patch of fallow land, there,
      by a covert of trees also tinged with yellow, or deepening to crimson and
      mauve&mdash;the harbinger of autumn. The sun had not the insistent and
      intensive strength of more southerly climes; it was buoyant, confident and
      heartening, and it shone in a turquoise vault which covered and endeared
      the wide, even world beneath. Now and then a flock of wild ducks whirred
      past, making for the marshes or the innumerable lakes that vitalised the
      expanse, or buzzards hunched heavily along, frightened from some far
      resort by eager sportsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was above; but beneath, on a level with the unlifted eye, were houses
      here and there, looking in the vastness like dolls&rsquo; habitations. Many of
      the houses stood blank and staring in the expanse, but some had trees, and
      others little oases of green. Everywhere prosperity, everywhere the
      strings of life pulled taut, signs that energy had been straining on the
      leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was one spot where it seemed that deadness made encampment. It
      could not be seen in the sweep of the eye, you must have travelled and
      looked vigilantly to find it; but it was there&mdash;a lake shimmering in
      the eager sun, washing against a reedy shore, a little river running into
      the reedy lake at one end and out at, the other, a small, dilapidated
      house half hid in a wood that stretched for half a mile or so upon a
      rising ground. In front of the house, not far from the lake, a man was
      lying asleep upon the ground, a rough felt hat drawn over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the house, the man seemed dilapidated also: a slovenly, ill-dressed,
      demoralised figure he looked, even with his face covered. He seemed in a
      deep sleep. Wild ducks settled on the lake not far from him with a swish
      and flutter; a coyote ran past, veering as it saw the recumbent figure; a
      prairie hen rustled by with a shrill cluck, but he seemed oblivious to
      all. If asleep, he was evidently dreaming, for now and then he started, or
      his body twitched, and a muttering came from beneath the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battered house, the absence of barn or stable or garden, or any token
      of thrift or energy, marked the man as an excrescence in this theatre of
      hope and fruitful toil. It all belonged to some degenerate land, some
      exhausted civilisation, not to this field of vigour where life rang like
      silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the man lay for hour upon hour. He slept as though he had been upon a
      long journey in which the body was worn to helplessness. Or was it that
      sleep of the worn-out spirit which, tortured by remembrance and remorse,
      at last sinks into the depths where the conscious vexes the unconscious&mdash;a
      little of fire, a little of ice, and now and then the turn of the screw?
    </p>
    <p>
      The day marched nobly on towards evening, growing out of its blue and
      silver into a pervasive golden gleam; the bare, greyish houses on the
      prairie were transformed into miniature palaces of light. Presently a girl
      came out of the woods behind, looking at the neglected house with a
      half-pitying curiosity. She carried in one hand a fishing rod which had
      been telescoped till it was no bigger than a cane; in the other she
      carried a small fishing basket. Her father&rsquo;s shooting and fishing camp was
      a few miles away by a lake of greater size than this which she approached.
      She had tired of the gay company in camp, brought up for sport from beyond
      the American border where she also belonged, and she had come to explore
      the river running into this reedy lake. She turned from the house and came
      nearer to the lake, shaking her head, as though compassionating the poor,
      folk who lived there. She was beautiful. Her hair was brown, going to
      tawny, but in this soft light which enwrapped her, she was in a sort of
      topaz flame. As she came on, suddenly she stopped as though transfixed.
      She saw the man&mdash;and saw also a tragedy afoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stirred violently in his sleep, cried out, and started up. As he
      did so, a snake, disturbed in its travel past him, suddenly raised itself
      in anger. Startled out of sleep by some inner torture, the man heard the
      sinister rattle he knew so well, and gazed paralysed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had been but a few feet away when she first saw the man and his
      angry foe. An instant, then, with the instinct of the woods and the
      plains, and the courage that has habitation everywhere, dropping her
      basket she sprang forward noiselessly. The short, telescoped fishing rod
      she carried swung round her head and completed its next half-circle at the
      head of the reptile, even as it was about to strike. The blow was sure,
      and with half-severed head the snake fell dead upon the ground beside the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was like one who has been projected from one world to another, dazed,
      stricken, fearful. Presently the look of agonised dismay gave way to such
      an expression of relief as might come upon the face of a reprieved victim
      about to be given to the fire, or to the knife that flays. The place of
      dreams from which he had emerged was like hell, and this was some world of
      peace that he had not known these many years. Always one had been at his
      elbow&mdash;&ldquo;a familiar spirit out of the ground&rdquo;&mdash;whispering in his
      ear. He had been down in the abysses of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced again at the girl, and realised what she had done: she had
      saved his life. Whether it had been worth saving was another question; but
      he had been near to the brink, had looked in, and the animal in him had
      shrunk back from the precipice in a confused agony of fear. He staggered
      to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; he said, pulling his coat closer to hide the
      ragged waistcoat underneath, and adjusting his worn and dirty hat&mdash;in
      his youth he had been vain and ambitious and good-looking also.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked his question in no impertinent tone, but in the low voice of one
      who &ldquo;shall whisper out of the dust.&rdquo; He had not yet recovered from the
      first impression of his awakening, that the world in which he now stood
      was not a real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood, and half in pity and half in conquered repugnance said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from a camp beyond&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated the direction by a
      gesture. &ldquo;I had been fishing&rdquo;&mdash;she took up the basket&mdash;&ldquo;and
      chanced on you&mdash;then.&rdquo; She glanced at the snake significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You killed it in the nick of time,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that still spoke
      of the ground, but with a note of half-shamed gratitude. &ldquo;I want to thank
      you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You were brave. It would have turned on you if you had
      missed. I know them. I&rsquo;ve killed five.&rdquo; He spoke very slowly, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are safe&mdash;that is the chief thing,&rdquo; she rejoined, making
      as though to depart. But presently she turned back. &ldquo;Why are you so
      dreadfully poor&mdash;and everything?&rdquo; she asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye wandered over the lake and back again before he answered her, in a
      dull, heavy tone: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had bad luck, and, when you get down, there are
      plenty to kick you farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t always poor as you are now&mdash;I mean long ago, when you
      were young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so old,&rdquo; he rejoined sluggishly&mdash;&ldquo;only thirty-four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not suppress her astonishment. She looked at the hair already
      grey, the hard, pinched face, the lustreless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it must seem long to you,&rdquo; she said with meaning. Now he laughed&mdash;a
      laugh sodden and mirthless. He was thinking of his boyhood. Everything,
      save one or two spots all fire or all darkness, was dim in his debilitated
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too far to go back,&rdquo; he said, with a gleam of the intelligence which had
      been strong in him once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the gleam. She had wisdom beyond her years. It was the greater
      because her mother was dead, and she had had so much wealth to dispense,
      for her father was rich beyond counting, and she controlled his household,
      and helped to regulate his charities. She saw that he was not of the
      labouring classes, that he had known better days; his speech, if abrupt
      and cheerless, was grammatical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cannot go back, you can go forwards,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;Why should
      you be the only man in this beautiful land who lives like this, who is
      idle when there is so much to do, who sleeps in the daytime when there is
      so much time to sleep at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush came on the greyish, colourless face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep at
      night,&rdquo; he returned moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sleep?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, but stirred the body of the snake with his foot. The
      tail moved; he stamped upon the head with almost frenzied violence, out of
      keeping with his sluggishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, yet looked back once more&mdash;she felt tragedy around
      her. &ldquo;It is never too late to mend,&rdquo; she said, and moved on, but stopped;
      for a young man came running from the woods towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a hunt&mdash;such a hunt for you,&rdquo; the young man said eagerly,
      then stopped short when he saw to whom she had been talking. A look of
      disgust came upon his face as he drew her away, his hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, why did you talk to that man?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ought not
      to have trusted yourself near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is he so bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about him. I inquired the other day. He was once in a better
      position as a ranchman&mdash;ten years ago; but he came into some money
      one day, and he changed at once. He never had a good character; even
      before he got his money he used to gamble, and was getting a bad name.
      Afterwards he began drinking, and he took to gambling harder than ever.
      Presently his money all went and he had to work; but his bad habits had
      fastened on him, and now he lives from hand to mouth, sometimes working
      for a month, sometimes idle for months. There&rsquo;s something sinister about
      him, there&rsquo;s some mystery; for poverty or drink even&mdash;and he doesn&rsquo;t
      drink much now&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t make him what he is. He doesn&rsquo;t seek
      company, and he walks sometimes endless miles talking to himself, going as
      hard as he can. How did you come to speak to him, Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him all, with a curious abstraction in her voice, for she was
      thinking of the man from a standpoint which her companion could not
      realise. She was also trying to verify something in her memory. Ten years
      ago, so her lover had just said, the poor wretch behind them had been a
      different man; and there had shot into her mind the face of a ranchman she
      had seen with her father, the railway king, one evening when his &ldquo;special&rdquo;
       had stopped at a railway station on his tour through Montana&mdash;ten
      years ago. Why did the face of the ranchman which had fixed itself on her
      memory then, because he had come on the evening of her birthday and had
      spoiled it for her, having taken her father away from her for an hour&mdash;why
      did his face come to her now? What had it to do with the face of this
      outcast she had just left?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roger Lygon,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roger Lygon,&rdquo; she repeated mechanically. Something in the man chained her
      thought&mdash;his face that moment when her hand saved him and the awful
      fear left him, and a glimmer of light came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her lover beside her broke into song. He was happy with her.
      Everything was before him, her beauty, her wealth, herself. He could not
      dwell upon dismal things; his voice rang out on the sharp sweet evening
      air:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, where did you get them, the bonny, bonny roses
     That blossom in your cheeks, and the morning in your eyes?&rsquo; 
     &lsquo;I got them on the North Trail, the road that never closes,
     That widens to the seven gold gates of paradise.&rsquo; 
     &lsquo;O come, let us camp in the North Trail together,
     With the night-fires lit and the tent-pegs down.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Left alone, the man by the reedy lake stood watching them until they were
      out of view. The song came back to him, echoing across the waters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O come, let us camp on the North Trail together,
     With the night-fires lit and the tent-pegs down.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The sunset glow, the girl&rsquo;s presence, had given him a moment&rsquo;s illusion,
      had absorbed him for a moment, acting on his deadened nature like a
      narcotic at once soothing and stimulating. As some wild animal in a
      forgotten land, coming upon ruins of a vast civilisation, towers, temples,
      and palaces, in the golden glow of an Eastern evening, stands abashed and
      vaguely wondering, having neither reason to understand, nor feeling to
      enjoy, yet is arrested and abashed, so he stood. He had lived the last
      three years so much alone, had been cut off so completely from his kind&mdash;had
      lived so much alone. Yet to-night, at last, he would not be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was coming to-night, some one whom he had not seen for a long
      time. Letters had passed, the object of the visit had been defined, and he
      had spent the intervening days since the last letter had arrived, now
      agitated, now apathetic and sullen, now struggling with some invisible
      being that kept whispering in his ear, saying to him, &ldquo;It was the price of
      fire, and blood, and shame. You did it&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;you! You
      are down, and you will never get up. You can only go lower still&mdash;fire,
      and blood, and shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Criminal as he was he had never become hardened, he had only become
      degraded. Crime was not his vocation. He had no gift for it; still the
      crime he had committed had never been discovered&mdash;the crime that he
      did with others. There were himself and Dupont and another. Dupont was
      coming to-night&mdash;Dupont who had profited by the crime, and had not
      spent his profits, but had built upon them to further profit; for Dupont
      was avaricious and prudent, and a born criminal. Dupont had never had any
      compunctions or remorse, had never lost a night&rsquo;s sleep because of what
      they two had done, instigated thereto by the other, who had paid them so
      well for the dark thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was Henderley, the financier. He was worse perhaps than Dupont,
      for he was in a different sphere of life, was rich beyond counting, and
      had been early nurtured in quiet Christian surroundings. The spirit of
      ambition, rivalry, and the methods of a degenerate and cruel finance had
      seized him, mastered him; so that, under the cloak of power&mdash;as a
      toreador hides the blade under the red cloth before his enemy the toro&mdash;he
      held a sword of capital which did cruel and vicious things, at last
      becoming criminal also. Henderley had incited and paid; the others, Dupont
      and Lygon, had acted and received. Henderley had had no remorse, none at
      any rate that weighed upon him; for he had got used to ruining rivals, and
      seeing strong men go down, and those who had fought him come to beg or
      borrow of him in the end. He had seen more than one commit suicide, and
      those they loved go down and farther down, and he had helped these up a
      little, but not enough to put them near his own plane again; and he could
      not see&mdash;it never occurred to him&mdash;that he had done any evil to
      them. Dupont thought upon his crimes now and then, and his heart hardened,
      for he had no moral feeling; Henderley did not think at all. It was left
      to the man of the reedy lake to pay the penalty of apprehension, to suffer
      the effects of crime upon a nature not naturally criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again, how many hundreds of times, had Roger Lygon seen in his
      sleep&mdash;had even seen awake so did hallucination possess him&mdash;the
      new cattle trail he had fired for scores of miles. The fire had destroyed
      the grass over millions of acres, two houses had been burned and three
      people had lost their lives; all to satisfy the savage desire of one man,
      to destroy the chance of a cattle trade over a great section of country
      for the railway which was to compete with his own&mdash;an act which, in
      the end, was futile, failed of its purpose. Dupont and Lygon had been paid
      their price, and had disappeared, and been forgotten&mdash;they were but
      pawns in his game&mdash;and there was no proof against Henderley.
      Henderley had forgotten. Lygon wished to forget, but Dupont remembered,
      and meant now to reap fresh profit by the remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dupont was coming to-night, and the hatchet of crime was to be dug up
      again. So it had been planned. As the shadows fell, Lygon roused himself
      from his trance with a shiver. It was not cold, but in him there was a
      nervous agitation, making him cold from head to foot; his body seemed as
      impoverished as his mind. Looking with heavy-lidded eyes across the
      prairie, he saw in the distance the barracks of the Riders of the Plains
      and the jail near by, and his shuddering ceased. There was where he
      belonged, within four stone walls; yet here he was free to go where he
      willed, to live as he willed, with no eye upon him. With no eye upon him?
      There was no eye, but there was the Whisperer whom he could never drive
      away. Morning and night he heard the words, &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;you!
      Fire, and blood, and shame!&rdquo; He had snatched sleep when he could find it,
      after long, long hours of tramping over the plains, ostensibly to shoot
      wild fowl, but in truth to bring on a great bodily fatigue&mdash;and
      sleep. His sleep only came then in the first watches of the night. As the
      night wore on the Whisperer began again, as the cloud of weariness lifted
      a little from him, and the senses were released from the heavy sedative of
      unnatural exertion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dusk deepened. The moon slowly rose. He cooked his scanty meal, and
      took a deep draught from a horn of whiskey from beneath a board in the
      flooring. He had not the courage to face Dupont without it, nor yet to
      forget what he must forget, if he was to do the work Dupont came to
      arrange&mdash;he must forget the girl who had saved his life and the
      influence of those strange moments in which she had spoken down to him, in
      the abyss where he had been lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the doorway, a fire gleaming behind him; he drank in the good
      air as though his lungs were thirsty for it, and saw the silver glitter of
      the moon upon the water. Not a breath of wind stirred, and the shining
      path the moon made upon the reedy lake fascinated his eye. Everything was
      so still except that whisper louder in his ear than it had ever been
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, upon the silver path upon the lake there shot a silent canoe,
      with a figure as silently paddling towards him. He gazed for a moment
      dismayed, and then got to his feet with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dupont,&rdquo; he said mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe swished among the reeds and rushes, scraped on the shore, and a
      tall, burly figure sprang from it, and stood still, looking at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Qui reste la&mdash;Lygon?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dupont,&rdquo; was the nervous, hesitating reply. Dupont came forwards quickly.
      &ldquo;Ah, ben, here we are again&mdash;so,&rdquo; he grunted cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the house they sat before the fire, holding their hands to the
      warmth from force of habit, though the night was not cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben, you will do it to-night&mdash;then?&rdquo; Dupont said. &ldquo;Sacre, it is
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; rejoined the other heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      An angry light leapt into Dupont&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You not unnerstan&rsquo; my
      letters-bah! You know it all right, so queeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other remained silent, staring into the fire with wide, searching
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dupont put a hand on him. &ldquo;You ketch my idee queeck. We mus&rsquo; have more
      money from that Henderley&mdash;certainlee. It is ten years, and he t&rsquo;ink
      it is all right. He t&rsquo;ink we come no more becos&rsquo; he give five t&rsquo;ousan&rsquo; 
      dollars to us each. That was to do the t&rsquo;ing, to fire the country. Now we
      want another ten t&rsquo;ousan&rsquo; to us each, to forget we do it for him&mdash;hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no reply. Dupont went on, watching the other furtively,
      for he did not like this silence. But he would not resent it till he was
      sure there was good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to suit us. He is over there at the Old Man Lak&rsquo;, where you can
      get at him easy, not like in the city where he lif&rsquo;. Over in the States,
      he laugh mebbe, becos&rsquo; he is at home, an&rsquo; can buy off the law. But here&mdash;it
      is Canadaw, an&rsquo; they not care eef he have hunder&rsquo; meellion dollar. He know
      that&mdash;sure. Eef you say you not care a dam to go to jail, so you can
      put him there, too, becos&rsquo; you have not&rsquo;ing, an&rsquo; so dam seeck of
      everyt&rsquo;ing, he will t&rsquo;ink ten t&rsquo;ousan&rsquo; dollar same as one cent to Nic
      Dupont&mdash;ben sur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lygon nodded his head, still holding his hands to the blaze. With ten
      thousand dollars he could get away into&mdash;into another world
      somewhere, some world where he could forget; as he forgot for a moment
      this afternoon when the girl said to him, &ldquo;It is never too late to mend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now as he thought of her, he pulled his coat together, and arranged the
      rough scarf at his neck involuntarily. Ten thousand dollars&mdash;but ten
      thousand dollars by blackmail, hush-money, the reward of fire, and blood,
      and shame! Was it to go on? Was he to commit a new crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stirred, as though to shake off the net that he felt twisting round
      him, in the hands of the robust and powerful Dupont, on whom crime sat so
      lightly, who had flourished while he, Lygon, had gone lower and lower. Ten
      years ago he had been the better man, had taken the lead, was the master,
      Dupont the obedient confederate, the tool. Now, Dupont, once the rough
      river-driver, grown prosperous in a large way for him&mdash;who might yet
      be mayor of his town in Quebec&mdash;he held the rod of rule. Lygon was
      conscious that the fifty dollars sent him every New Year for five years by
      Dupont had been sent with a purpose, and that he was now Dupont&rsquo;s tool.
      Debilitated, demoralised, how could he, even if he wished, struggle
      against this powerful confederate, as powerful in will as in body? Yet if
      he had his own way he would not go to Henderley. He had lived with &ldquo;a
      familiar spirit&rdquo; so long, he feared the issue of this next excursion into
      the fens of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dupont was on his feet now. &ldquo;He will be here only three days more&mdash;I
      haf find it so. To-night it mus&rsquo; be done. As we go I will tell you what to
      say. I will wait at the Forks, an&rsquo; we will come back togedder. His cheque
      will do. Eef he gif at all, the cheque is all right. He will not stop it.
      Eef he haf the money, it is better&mdash;sacre&mdash;yes. Eef he not gif&mdash;well,
      I will tell you, there is the other railway man he try to hurt, how would
      he like&mdash;But I will tell you on the river. Main&rsquo;enant&mdash;queeck,
      we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word Lygon took down another coat and put it on. Doing so he
      concealed a weapon quickly as Dupont stooped to pick a coal for his pipe
      from the blaze. Lygon had no fixed purpose in taking a weapon with him; it
      was only a vague instinct of caution that moved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the canoe on the river, in an almost speechless apathy, he heard
      Dupont&rsquo;s voice giving him instructions.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        .......................
</pre>
    <p>
      Henderley, the financier, had just finished his game of whist and
      dismissed his friends&mdash;it was equivalent to dismissal, rough yet
      genial as he seemed to be, so did immense wealth and its accompanying
      power affect his relations with those about him. In everything he was
      &ldquo;considered.&rdquo; He was in good humour, for he had won all the evening, and
      with a smile he rubbed his hands among the notes&mdash;three thousand
      dollars it was. It was like a man with a pocket full of money, chuckling
      over a coin he has found in the street. Presently he heard a rustle of the
      inner tent-curtain and swung round. He faced the man from the reedy lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively he glanced round for a weapon, mechanically his hands firmly
      grasped the chair in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been in danger of his life many times, and he had no fear. He had
      been threatened with assassination more than once, and he had got used to
      the idea of danger; life to him was only a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his nerve; he did not call out; he looked his visitor in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here? Who are you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; answered Lygon, gazing intently at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face to face with the man who had tempted him to crime, Lygon had a new
      sense of boldness, a sudden feeling of reprisal, a rushing desire to put
      the screw upon him. At sight of this millionaire with the pile of notes
      before him there vanished the sickening hesitation of the afternoon, of
      the journey with Dupont. The look of the robust, healthy financier was
      like acid in a wound; it maddened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know me better soon,&rdquo; Lygon added, his head twitching with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderley recognised him now. He gripped the armchair spasmodically, but
      presently regained a complete composure. He knew the game that was forward
      here; and he also thought that if once he yielded to blackmail there would
      never be an end to it. He made no pretence, but came straight to the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do nothing; there is no proof,&rdquo; he said with firm assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Dupont,&rdquo; answered Lygon doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Dupont?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French Canadian who helped me&mdash;I divided with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said the man who helped you died. You wrote that to me. I suppose you
      are lying now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderley coolly straightened the notes on the table, smoothing out the
      wrinkles, arranging them according to their denominations with an
      apparently interested eye; yet he was vigilantly watching the outcast
      before him. To yield to blackmail would be fatal; not to yield to it&mdash;he
      could not see his way. He had long ago forgotten the fire, and blood, and
      shame. No Whisperer reminded him of that black page in the history of his
      life; he had been immune of conscience. He could not understand this man
      before him. It was as bad a case of human degradation as ever he had seen&mdash;he
      remembered the stalwart, if dissipated, ranchman who had acted on his
      instigation. He knew now that he had made a foolish blunder then, that the
      scheme had been one of his failures; but he had never looked on it as with
      eyes reproving crime. As a hundred thoughts tending towards the solution
      of the problem by which he was faced, flashed through his mind, and he
      rejected them all, he repeated mechanically the phrase, &ldquo;I suppose you are
      lying now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dupont is here&mdash;not a mile away,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He will give
      proof. He would go to jail or to the gallows to put you there, if you do
      not pay. He is a devil&mdash;Dupont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the great man could not see his way out. He must temporise for a
      little longer, for rashness might bring scandal or noise; and near by was
      his daughter, the apple of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want? How much did you figure you could get out of me, if I
      let you bleed me?&rdquo; he asked sneeringly and coolly. &ldquo;Come now, how much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lygon, in whom a blind hatred of the man still raged, was about to reply,
      when he heard a voice calling, &ldquo;Daddy, Daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the red, half-insane light died down in Lygon&rsquo;s eyes. He saw the
      snake upon the ground by the reedy lake, the girl standing over it&mdash;the
      girl with the tawny hair. This was her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderley had made a step towards a curtain opening into another room of
      the great tent, but before he could reach it the curtain was pushed back,
      and the girl entered with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; she said; then stood still astonished; seeing Lygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once a look came into her face which stirred it as a flying insect
      stirs the water of a pool. On the instant she remembered that she had seen
      the man before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten years ago in Montana on the night of her birthday. Her father
      had been called away to talk with this man, and she had seen him from the
      steps of the &ldquo;special.&rdquo; It was only the caricature of the once strong,
      erect ranchman that she saw, but there was no mistake, she recognised him
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lygon, dumfounded, looked from her to her father, and he saw now in
      Henderley&rsquo;s eyes a fear that was not to be misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was where Henderley could be smitten, could be brought to his knees.
      It was the vulnerable part of him. Lygon could see that he was stunned.
      The great financier was in his power. He looked back again to the girl,
      and her face was full of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp suspicion was in her heart that somehow or other her father was
      responsible for this man&rsquo;s degradation and ruin. She looked Lygon in the
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want to see me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely knew why she said it; but she was sensible of trouble, maybe
      of tragedy, somewhere; and she had a vague dread of she knew not what, for
      hide it, avoid it, as she had done so often, there was in her heart an
      unhappy doubt concerning her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great change had come over Lygon. Her presence had altered him. He was
      again where she had left him in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her say to her father, &ldquo;This was the man I told you of&mdash;at
      the reedy lake. Did you come to see me?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know you were here,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I came&rdquo;&mdash;he was
      conscious of Henderley&rsquo;s staring eyes fixed upon him helplessly&mdash;&ldquo;I
      came to ask your father if he would not buy my shack. There is good
      shooting at the lake; the ducks come plenty, sometimes. I want to get
      away, to start again somewhere. I&rsquo;ve been a failure. I want to get away,
      right away south. If he would buy it I could start again. I&rsquo;ve had no
      luck.&rdquo; He had invented it on the moment, but the girl understood better
      than Lygon or Henderley could have dreamed. She had seen the change pass
      over Lygon. Henderley had a hand on himself again, and the startled look
      went out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want for your shack and the lake?&rdquo; he asked with restored
      confidence. The fellow no doubt was grateful that his daughter had saved
      his life, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred dollars,&rdquo; answered Lygon quickly. Henderley would have
      handed over all that lay on the table before him but that he thought it
      better not to do so. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You seem to have been hit
      hard. Here is the money. Bring me the deed to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take the money till I give you the deed,&rdquo; said Lygon. &ldquo;It will
      do to-morrow. It&rsquo;s doing me a good turn. I&rsquo;ll get away and start again
      somewhere. I&rsquo;ve done no good up here. Thank you, sir&mdash;thank you.&rdquo;
       Before they realised it, the tent-curtain rose and fell, and he was gone
      into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble was still deep in the girl&rsquo;s eyes as she kissed her father,
      and he, with an overdone cheerfulness, wished her a good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of iron had been changed into a man of straw once at least in his
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lygon found Dupont at the Forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh ben, it is all right&mdash;yes?&rdquo; Dupont asked eagerly as Lygon joined
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is all right,&rdquo; answered Lygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an exulting laugh and an obscene oath, Dupont pushed out the canoe,
      and they got away into the moonlight. No word was spoken for some
      distance, but Dupont kept giving grunts of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got the ten t&rsquo;ousan&rsquo; each&mdash;in cash or cheque, eh? The cheque or
      the money-hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing,&rdquo; answered Lygon. Dupont dropped his paddle with a
      curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got not&rsquo;ing! You said eet was all right,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right. I got nothing. I asked for nothing. I have had enough. I
      have finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a roar of rage Dupont sprang on him, and caught him by the throat as
      the canoe swayed and dipped. He was blind with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lygon tried with one hand for his knife, and got it, but the pressure on
      his throat was growing terrible. For minutes the struggle continued, for
      Lygon was fighting with the desperation of one who makes his last awful
      onset against fate and doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dupont also had his knife at work. At last it drank blood, but as he got
      it home, he suddenly reeled blindly, lost his balance, and lurched into
      the water with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lygon, weapon in hand, and bleeding freely, waited for him to rise and
      make for the canoe again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten, twenty, fifty seconds passed. Dupont did not rise. A minute went by,
      and still there was no stir, no sign. Dupont would never rise again. In
      his wild rage he had burst a blood vessel on the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lygon bound up his reeking wound as best he could. He did&mdash;it calmly,
      whispering to himself the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do it. I must get there if I can. I will not be afraid to die
      then,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. Presently he grasped an oar and paddled
      feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight wind had risen, and, as he turned the boat in to face the Forks
      again, it helped to carry the canoe to the landing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lygon dragged himself out. He did not try to draw the canoe up, but began
      this journey of a mile back to the tent he had left so recently. First,
      step by step, leaning against trees, drawing himself forwards, a journey
      as long to his determined mind as from youth to age. Would it never end?
      It seemed a terrible climbing up the sides of a cliff, and, as he
      struggled fainting on, all sorts of sounds were in his ears, but he
      realised that the Whisperer was no longer there. The sounds he heard did
      not torture, they helped his stumbling feet. They were like the murmur of
      waters, like the sounds of the forest and soft, booming bells. But the
      bells were only the beatings of his heart-so loud, so swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his knees now crawling on-on-on. At last there came a light,
      suddenly bursting on him from a tent, he was so near. Then he called, and
      called again, and fell forwards on his face. But now he heard a voice
      above him. It was her voice. He had blindly struggled on to die near her,
      near where she was, she was so pitiful and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had accomplished his journey, and her voice was speaking above him.
      There were other voices, but it was only hers that he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help him&mdash;oh, God help him!&rdquo; she was saying. He drew a long
      quiet breath. &ldquo;I will sleep now,&rdquo; he said clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would hear the Whisperer no more.

      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reaped and I&rsquo;m sowing, the same as you, Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other made a nervous motion of protest. &ldquo;No; not the same as me, Flood&mdash;not

    <p>
      &ldquo;Thief-thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flood Rawley dropped the flaming match with which he was about to light a
      cheroot, and stood staring, his dark-blue eyes growing wider, his worn,
      handsome face becoming drawn, as swift conviction mastered him. He felt
      that the black words which had fallen from his friend&rsquo;s lips&mdash;from
      the lips of Diana Welldon&rsquo;s brother&mdash;were the truth. He looked at the
      plump face, the full amiable eyes, now misty with fright, at the
      characterless hand nervously feeling the golden moustache, at the
      well-fed, inert body; and he knew that whatever the trouble or the peril,
      Dan Welldon could not surmount it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Rawley asked rather sharply, his fingers running through his
      slightly grizzled, black hair, but not excitedly, for he wanted no scenes;
      and if this thing could hurt Di Welldon, and action was necessary, he must
      remain cool. What she was to him, Heaven and he only knew; what she had
      done for him, perhaps neither understood fully as yet. &ldquo;What is it&mdash;quick?&rdquo;
       he added, and his words were like a sharp grip upon Dan Welldon&rsquo;s
      shoulder. &ldquo;Racing&mdash;cards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan nodded. &ldquo;Yes, over at Askatoon; five hundred on Jibway, the favourite&mdash;he
      fell at the last fence; five hundred at poker with Nick Fison; and a
      thousand in land speculation at Edmonton, on margin. Everything went
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you put your hand in the railway company&rsquo;s money-chest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed such a dead certainty&mdash;Jibway; and the Edmonton
      corner-blocks, too. I&rsquo;d had luck with Nick before; but&mdash;well, there
      it is, Flood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know&mdash;the railway people&mdash;Shaughnessy knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the president knows. He&rsquo;s at Calgary now. They telegraphed him, and
      he wired to give me till midnight to pay up, or go to jail. They&rsquo;re
      watching me now. I can&rsquo;t stir. There&rsquo;s no escape, and there&rsquo;s no one I can
      ask for help but you. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve come, Flood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, what a fool! Couldn&rsquo;t you see what the end would be, if your
      plunging didn&rsquo;t come off? You&mdash;you oughtn&rsquo;t to bet, or speculate, or
      play cards, you&rsquo;re not clever enough. You&rsquo;ve got blind rashness, and so
      you think you&rsquo;re bold. And Di&mdash;oh, you idiot! And on a salary of a
      thousand dollars a year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Di would help me; but I couldn&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo; The weak face
      puckered, a lifeless kind of tear gathered in the ox-like eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she probably would help you. She&rsquo;d probably give you all she&rsquo;s saved
      to go to Europe with and study, saved from her pictures sold at twenty per
      cent of their value; and she&rsquo;d mortgage the little income she&rsquo;s got to
      keep her brother out of jail. Of course she would, and of course you ought
      to be ashamed of yourself for thinking of it.&rdquo; Rawley lighted his cigar
      and smoked fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better for her than my going to jail,&rdquo; stubbornly replied the
      other. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to tell her, or to ask her for money. That&rsquo;s why
      I&rsquo;ve come to you. You needn&rsquo;t be so hard, Flood; you&rsquo;ve not been a saint;
      and Di knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rawley took the cheroot from his mouth, threw back his head, and laughed
      mirthlessly, ironically. Then suddenly he stopped and looked round the
      room till his eyes rested on a portrait-drawing which hung on the wall
      opposite the window, through which the sun poured. It was the face of a
      girl with beautiful bronzed hair, and full, fine, beautifully modelled
      face, with brown eyes deep and brooding, which seemed to have time and
      space behind them&mdash;not before them. The lips were delicate and full,
      and had the look suggesting a smile which the inward thought has stayed.
      It was like one of the Titian women&mdash;like a Titian that hangs on the
      wall of the Gallery at Munich. The head and neck, the whole personality,
      had an air of distinction and destiny. The drawing had been done by a
      wandering duchess who had seen the girl sketching in the foothills, when
      on a visit to that &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; which has such power to refine and inspire
      minds not superior to Nature. Its replica was carried to a castle in
      Scotland. It had been the gift of Diana Welldon on a certain day not long
      ago, when Flood Rawley had made a pledge to her, which was as vital to him
      and to his future as two thousand dollars were vital to Dan Welldon now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been a saint, and Di knows it,&rdquo; repeated the weak brother of a
      girl whose fame belonged to the West; whose name was a signal for cheerful
      looks; whose buoyant humour and impartial friendliness gained her
      innumerable friends; and whose talent, understood by few, gave her a
      certain protection, lifting her a little away from the outwardly crude and
      provincial life around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rawley spoke, it was with quiet deliberation, and even gentleness. &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t been a saint, and she knows it, as you say, Dan; but the law is on
      my side as yet, and it isn&rsquo;t on yours. There&rsquo;s the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to gamble yourself; you were pretty tough, and you oughtn&rsquo;t to
      walk up my back with hobnailed boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I gambled, Dan, and I drank, and I raised a dust out here. My record
      was writ pretty big. But I didn&rsquo;t lay my hands on the ark of the social
      covenant, whose inscription is, Thou shalt not steal; and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
      poor but proud, and no one&rsquo;s watching for me round the corner, same as
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Welldon&rsquo;s half-defiant petulance disappeared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be
      undone.&rdquo; Then, with a sudden burst of anguish: &ldquo;Oh, get me out of this
      somehow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? I&rsquo;ve got no money. By speaking to your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I do it?&rdquo; Rawley peered anxiously into the other&rsquo;s face, and he
      knew that there was no real security against the shameful trouble being
      laid bare to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a chance to start straight again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was fluttered, almost whining; it carried no conviction; but the
      words had in them a reminder of words that Rawley himself had said to
      Diana Welldon but a few months ago, and a new spirit stirred in him. He
      stepped forwards and, gripping Dan&rsquo;s shoulder with a hand of steel, said
      fiercely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dan. I&rsquo;d rather take you to her in your coffin. She&rsquo;s never known
      you, never seen what most of us have seen, that all you have&mdash;or
      nearly all&mdash;is your lovely looks, and what they call a kind heart.
      There&rsquo;s only you two in your family, and she&rsquo;s got to live with you&mdash;awhile,
      anyhow. She couldn&rsquo;t stand this business. She mustn&rsquo;t stand it. She&rsquo;s had
      enough to put up with in me; but at the worst she could pass me by on the
      other side, and there would be an end. It would have been said that Flood
      Rawley had got his deserts. It&rsquo;s different with you.&rdquo; His voice changed,
      softened. &ldquo;Dan, I made a pledge to her that I&rsquo;d never play cards again for
      money while I lived, and it wasn&rsquo;t a thing to take on without some
      cogitation. But I cogitated, and took it on, and started life over again&mdash;me!
      Began practising law again&mdash;barrister, solicitor, notary public&mdash;at
      forty. And at last I&rsquo;ve got my chance in a big case against the Canadian
      Pacific. It&rsquo;ll make me or break me, Dan.... There, I wanted you to see
      where I stand with Di; and now I want you to promise me that you&rsquo;ll not
      leave these rooms till I see you again. I&rsquo;ll get you clear; I&rsquo;ll save you,
      Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flood! Oh, my God, Flood!&rdquo; The voice was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to stay here, and you&rsquo;re to remember not to get the funk, even
      if I don&rsquo;t come before midnight. I&rsquo;ll be here then, if I&rsquo;m alive. If you
      don&rsquo;t keep your word&mdash;but, there, you will.&rdquo; Both hands gripped the
      graceful shoulders of the miscreant like a vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me, Flood,&rdquo; was the frightened, whispered reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it up
      to you somehow, some day. I&rsquo;ll pay you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rawley caught up his cap from the table. &ldquo;Steady&mdash;steady. Don&rsquo;t go at
      a fence till you&rsquo;re sure of your seat, Dan,&rdquo; he said. Then with a long
      look at the portrait on the wall, and an exclamation which the other did
      not hear, he left the room with a set, determined face.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        ......................
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you? What brought you, Flood?&rdquo; the girl asked, her chin in her
      long, white hands, her head turned from the easel to him, a book in her
      lap, the sun breaking through the leaves upon her hat, touching the Titian
      hair with splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fate brought me, and didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; he answered, with a whimsical quirk
      of the mouth, and his trouble lurking behind the sea-deep eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you have come if you knew I was here?&rdquo; she urged archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for two thousand dollars,&rdquo; he answered, the look of trouble deepening
      in his eyes, but his lips were smiling. He had a quaint sense of humour,
      and at his last gasp would have noted the ridiculous thing. And surely it
      was a droll malignity of Fate to bring him here to her whom, in this
      moment of all moments in his life, he wished far away. Fate meant to try
      him to the uttermost. This hurdle of trial was high indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand dollars&mdash;nothing less?&rdquo; she inquired gaily. &ldquo;You are
      too specific for a real lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fate fixed the amount,&rdquo; he added drily. &ldquo;Fate&mdash;you talk so much of
      Fate,&rdquo; she replied gravely, and her eyes looked into the distance. &ldquo;You
      make me think of it too, and I don&rsquo;t want to do so. I don&rsquo;t want to feel
      helpless, to be the child of Accident and Destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you get the same thing in the &lsquo;fore-ordination&rsquo; that old Minister
      M&rsquo;Gregor preaches every Sunday. &lsquo;Be elect or be damned,&rsquo; he says to us
      all. Names aren&rsquo;t important; but, anyhow, it was Fate that led me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it wasn&rsquo;t me?&rdquo; she asked softly. &ldquo;Are you sure I wasn&rsquo;t
      calling you, and you had to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was en route, anyhow; and you are always calling, if I must tell
      you,&rdquo; he laughed. Suddenly he became grave. &ldquo;I hear you call me in the
      night sometimes, and I start up and say &lsquo;Yes, Di!&rsquo; out of my sleep. It&rsquo;s a
      queer hallucination. I&rsquo;ve got you on the brain, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to vex you&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; she said, opening the book that lay
      in her lap, &ldquo;and your eyes trouble me to-day. They&rsquo;ve got a look that used
      to be in them, Flood, before&mdash;before you promised; and another look I
      don&rsquo;t understand and don&rsquo;t like. I suppose it&rsquo;s always so. The real
      business of life is trying to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have wonderful thoughts for one that&rsquo;s had so little chance,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a genius, I suppose. Teaching can&rsquo;t give that
      sort of thing&mdash;the insight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Flood?&rdquo; she asked suddenly again, her breast heaving,
      her delicate, rounded fingers interlacing. &ldquo;I heard a man say once that
      you were &lsquo;as deep as the sea.&rsquo; He did not mean it kindly, but I do. You
      are in trouble, and I want to share it if I can. Where were you going when
      you came across me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see old Busby, the quack-doctor up there,&rdquo; he answered, nodding
      towards a shrubbed and wooded hillock behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Busby!&rdquo; she rejoined in amazement. &ldquo;What do you want with him&mdash;not
      medicine of that old quack, that dreadful man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cures people sometimes. A good many out here owe him more than they&rsquo;ll
      ever pay him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he as rich an old miser as they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look rich, does he?&rdquo; was the enigmatical answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does any one know his real history? He didn&rsquo;t come from nowhere. He must
      have had friends once. Some one must once have cared for him, though he
      seems such a monster now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet he cures people sometimes,&rdquo; he rejoined abstractedly. &ldquo;Probably
      there&rsquo;s some good underneath. I&rsquo;m going to try and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it. What is your business with him? Won&rsquo;t you tell me? Is it so
      secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want him to help me in a case I&rsquo;ve got in hand. A client of mine is in
      trouble&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t ask about it; and he can help, I think&mdash;I
      think so.&rdquo; He got to his feet. &ldquo;I must be going, Di,&rdquo; he added. Suddenly a
      flush swept over his face, and he reached out and took both her hands.
      &ldquo;Oh, you are a million times too good for me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if all goes
      well, I&rsquo;ll do my best to make you forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;wait one moment,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Before you go, I want you to
      hear what I&rsquo;ve been reading over and over to myself just now. It is from a
      book I got from Quebec, called &lsquo;When Time Shall Pass&rsquo;. It is a story of
      two like you and me. The man is writing to the woman, and it has things
      that you have said to me&mdash;in a different way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t talk like a book, but I know a star in a dark night when I
      see it,&rdquo; he answered, with a catch in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; she said, catching his hand in hers, as she read, while all around
      them the sounds of summer&mdash;the distant clack of a reaper, the crack
      of a whip, the locusts droning, the whir of a young partridge, the squeak
      of a chipmunk&mdash;were tuned to the harmony of the moment and her voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;&lsquo;Night and the sombre silence, oh, my love, and one star shining!
   First, warm, velvety sleep, and then this quick, quiet waking to
   your voice which seems to call me. Is it&mdash;is it you that calls?
   Do you sometimes, even in your dreams, speak to me? Far beneath
   unconsciousness is there the summons of your spirit to me?...
   I like to think so. I like to think that this thing which has come
   to us is deeper, greater than we are. Sometimes day and night there
   flash before my eyes&mdash;my mind&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;pictures of you and me in
   places unfamiliar, landscapes never before seen, activities
   uncomprehended and unknown, bright, alluring glimpses of some second
   being, some possible, maybe never-to-be-realised future, alas! Yet
   these swift-moving shutters of the soul, or imagination, or reality
   &mdash;who shall say which?&mdash;give me a joy never before felt in life. If
   I am not a better man for this love of mine for you, I am more than
   I was, and shall be more than I am. Much of my life in the past was
   mean and small, so much that I have said and done has been unworthy
   &mdash;my love for you is too sharp a light for my gross imperfections of
   the past! Come what will, be what must, I stake my life, my heart,
   my soul on you&mdash;that beautiful, beloved face; those deep eyes in
   which my being is drowned; those lucid, perfect hands that have
   bound me to the mast of your destiny. I cannot go back, I must go
   forwards: now I must keep on loving you or be shipwrecked. I did
   not know that this was in me, this tide of love, this current of
   devotion. Destiny plays me beyond my ken, beyond my dreams.
   O Cithaeron! Turn from me now&mdash;or never, O my love! Loose me
   from the mast, and let the storm and wave wash me out into the sea
   of your forgetfulness now&mdash;or never!... But keep me, keep me,
   if your love is great enough, if I bring you any light or joy; for I
   am yours to my uttermost note of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew&mdash;he knew!&rdquo; Rawley said, catching her wrists in his hands and
      drawing her to him. &ldquo;If I could write, that&rsquo;s what I should have said to
      you, beautiful and beloved. How mean and small and ugly my life was till
      you made me over. I was a bad lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much hung on one little promise,&rdquo; she said, and drew closer to him.
      &ldquo;You were never bad,&rdquo; she added; then, with an arm sweeping the universe,
      &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it all good, and isn&rsquo;t it all worth living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face lost its glow. Over in the town her brother faced a ruined life,
      and the girl beside him, a dark humiliation and a shame which would poison
      her life hereafter, unless&mdash;his look turned to the little house where
      the quack-doctor lived. He loosed her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for Caliban,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be Ariel and follow you-in my heart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Be sure and make
      him tell you the story of his life,&rdquo; she added with a laugh, as his lips
      swept the hair behind her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he moved swiftly away, watching his long strides, she said proudly, &ldquo;As
      deep as the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment she added: &ldquo;And he was once a gambler, until, until&mdash;&rdquo;
       she glanced at the open book, then with sweet mockery looked at her hands&mdash;&ldquo;until
      &lsquo;those lucid, perfect hands bound me to the mast of your destiny.&rsquo; O vain
      Diana! But they are rather beautiful,&rdquo; she added softly, &ldquo;and I am rather
      happy.&rdquo; There was something like a gay little chuckle in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O vain Diana!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>

        .......................
</pre>
    <p>
      Rawley entered the door of the but on the hill without ceremony. There was
      no need for courtesy, and the work he had come to do could be easier done
      without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Busby was crouched over a table, his mouth lapping milk from a full
      bowl on the table. He scarcely raised his head when Rawley entered&mdash;through
      the open door he had seen his visitor coming. He sipped on, his straggling
      beard dripping. There was silence for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he growled at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish your swill, and then we can talk,&rdquo; said Rawley carelessly. He took
      a chair near the door, lighted a cheroot and smoked, watching the old man,
      as he tipped the great bowl towards his face, as though it were some wild
      animal feeding. The clothes were patched and worn, the coat-front was
      spattered with stains of all kinds, the hair and beard were unkempt and
      long, giving him what would have been the look of a mangy lion, but that
      the face had the expression of some beast less honourable. The eyes,
      however, were malignantly intelligent, the hands, ill-cared for, were
      long, well-shaped and capable, but of a hateful yellow colour like the
      face. And through all was a sense of power, dark and almost mediaeval.
      Secret, evilly wise and inhuman, he looked a being apart, whom men might
      seek for help in dark purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want&mdash;medicine?&rdquo; he muttered at last, wiping his beard
      and mouth with the palm of his hand, and the palm on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rawley looked at the ominous-looking bottles on the shelves above the old
      man&rsquo;s head; at the forceps, knives, and other surgical instruments on the
      walls&mdash;they at least were bright and clean&mdash;and, taking the
      cheroot slowly from his mouth, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shin-plasters are what I want. A friend of mine has caught his leg in a
      trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man gave an evil chuckle at the joke, for a &ldquo;shin-plaster&rdquo; was a
      money-note worth a quarter of a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some,&rdquo; he growled in reply, &ldquo;but they cost twenty-five cents
      each. You can have them for your friend at the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want eight thousand of them from you. He&rsquo;s hurt pretty bad,&rdquo; was the
      dogged, dry answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaggy eyebrows of the quack drew together, and the eyes peered out
      sharply through half-closed lids. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of wanting and not much
      getting in this world,&rdquo; he rejoined, with a leer of contempt, and spat on
      the floor, while yet the furtive watchfulness of the eyes indicated a mind
      ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smoke came in placid puffs from the cheroot&mdash;Rawley was smoking very
      hard, but with a judicial meditation, as it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but if you want a thing so bad that, to get it, you&rsquo;ll face the
      devil or the Beast of Revelations, it&rsquo;s likely to come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call me a beast?&rdquo; The reddish-brown face grew black like that of a
      Bedouin in his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said the Beast of Revelations&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know the Scriptures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that a fool is to be answered according to his folly,&rdquo; was the
      hoarse reply, and the great head wagged to and fro in its smarting rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m doing my best; and perhaps when the folly is all out, we&rsquo;ll
      come to the revelations of the Beast.&rdquo; There was a silence, in which the
      gross impostor shifted heavily in his seat, while a hand twitched across
      the mouth, and then caught at the breast of the threadbare black coat
      abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rawley leaned forward, one elbow on a knee, the cheroot in his fingers. He
      spoke almost confidentially, as to some ignorant and misguided savage&mdash;as
      he had talked to Indian chiefs in his time, when searching for the truth
      regarding some crime:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a lot of revelations in my time. A lawyer and a doctor always
      do. And though there are folks who say I&rsquo;m no lawyer, as there are those
      who say with greater truth that you&rsquo;re no doctor, speaking technically,
      we&rsquo;ve both had &lsquo;revelations.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ve seen a lot that&rsquo;s seamy, and so have
      I. You&rsquo;re pretty seamy yourself. In fact, you&rsquo;re as bad a man as ever
      saved lives&mdash;and lost them. You&rsquo;ve had a long tether, and you&rsquo;ve
      swung on it&mdash;swung wide. But you&rsquo;ve had a lot of luck that you
      haven&rsquo;t swung high, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and flicked away the ash from his cheroot, while the figure
      before him swayed animal-like from side to side, muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got brains, a great lot of brains of a kind&mdash;however you came
      by them,&rdquo; Rawley continued; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve kept a lot of people in the West
      from passing in their cheques before their time. You&rsquo;ve rooked &lsquo;em,
      chiselled &lsquo;em out of a lot of cash, too. There was old Lamson&mdash;fifteen
      hundred for the goitre on his neck; and Mrs. Gilligan for the cancer&mdash;two
      thousand, wasn&rsquo;t it? Tincture of Lebanon leaves you called the medicine,
      didn&rsquo;t you? You must have made fifty thousand or so in the last ten
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve made I&rsquo;ll keep,&rdquo; was the guttural answer, and the talon-like
      fingers clawed the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made people pay high for curing them, saving them sometimes; but
      you haven&rsquo;t paid me high for saving you in the courts; and there&rsquo;s one
      case that you haven&rsquo;t paid me for at all. That was when the patient died&mdash;and
      you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the old man became mottled with a sudden fear, but he jerked
      it forwards once or twice with an effort at self-control. Presently he
      steadied to the ordeal of suspense, while he kept saying to himself, &ldquo;What
      does he know&mdash;what&mdash;which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malpractice resulting in death&mdash;that was poor Jimmy Tearle; and
      something else resulting in death&mdash;that was the switchman&rsquo;s wife. And
      the law is hard in the West where a woman&rsquo;s in the case&mdash;quick and
      hard. Yes, you&rsquo;ve swung wide on your tether; look out that you don&rsquo;t swing
      high, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can prove nothing; it&rsquo;s bluff;&rdquo; came the reply in a tone of malice
      and of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget. I was your lawyer in Jimmy Tearle&rsquo;s case, and a letter&rsquo;s been
      found written by the switchman&rsquo;s wife to her husband. It reached me the
      night he was killed by the avalanche. It was handed over to me by the
      post-office, as the lawyer acting for the relatives. I&rsquo;ve read it. I&rsquo;ve
      got it. It gives you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo; Fear had now disappeared, and the old man was fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you weren&rsquo;t alone; and if the switchman and the switchman&rsquo;s wife
      weren&rsquo;t dead and out of it all; and if the other man that didn&rsquo;t matter
      any more than you wasn&rsquo;t alive and hadn&rsquo;t a family that does matter, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be asking you peaceably for two thousand dollars as my fee for
      getting you off two cases that might have sent you to prison for twenty
      years, or, maybe, hung you to the nearest tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy body pulled itself together, the hands clinched. &ldquo;Blackmail-you
      think I&rsquo;ll stand it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think you will. I want two thousand dollars to help a friend in a
      hole, and I mean to have it, if you think your neck&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teeth, wonderfully white, showed through the shaggy beard. &ldquo;If I had to go
      to prison&mdash;or swing, as you say, do you think I&rsquo;d go with my mouth
      shut? I&rsquo;d not pay up alone. The West would crack&mdash;holy Heaven, I know
      enough to make it sick. Go on and see! I&rsquo;ve got the West in my hand.&rdquo; He
      opened and shut his fingers with a grimace of cruelty which shook Rawley
      in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rawley had trusted to the inspiration of the moment; he had had no clearly
      defined plan; he had believed that he could frighten the old man, and by
      force of will bend him to his purposes. It had all been more difficult
      than he had expected. He kept cool, imperturbable, and determined,
      however. He knew that what the old quack said was true&mdash;the West
      might shake with scandal concerning a few who, no doubt, in remorse and
      secret fear, had more than paid the penalty of their offences. But he
      thought of Di Welldon and of her criminal brother, and every nerve, every
      faculty was screwed to its utmost limit of endurance and capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the old man gave a new turn to the event. He got up and,
      rummaging in an old box, drew out a dice-box. Rattling the dice, he threw
      them out on the table before him, a strange, excited look crossing his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play for it,&rdquo; he said in a harsh, croaking voice. &ldquo;Play for the two
      thousand. Win it if you can. You want it bad. I want to keep it bad. It&rsquo;s
      nice to have; it makes a man feel warm&mdash;money does. I&rsquo;d sleep in
      ten-dollar bills, I&rsquo;d have my clothes made of them, if I could; I&rsquo;d have
      my house papered with them; I&rsquo;d eat &lsquo;em. Oh, I know, I know about you&mdash;and
      her&mdash;Diana Welldon! You&rsquo;ve sworn off gambling, and you&rsquo;ve kept your
      pledge for near a year. Well, it&rsquo;s twenty years since I gambled&mdash;twenty
      years. I gambled with these then.&rdquo; He shook the dice in the box. &ldquo;I
      gambled everything I had away&mdash;more than two thousand dollars, more
      than two thousand dollars.&rdquo; He laughed a raw, mirthless laugh. &ldquo;Well,
      you&rsquo;re the greatest gambler in the West. So was I-in the East. It
      pulverised me at last, when I&rsquo;d nothing left&mdash;and drink, drink,
      drink. I gave up both one night and came out West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started doctoring here. I&rsquo;ve got money, plenty of money&mdash;medicine,
      mines, land got it for me. I&rsquo;ve been lucky. Now you come to bluff me&mdash;me!
      You don&rsquo;t know old Busby.&rdquo; He spat on the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to be bluffed. I
      know too much. Before they could lynch me I&rsquo;d talk. But to play you, the
      greatest gambler in the West, for two thousand dollars&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;d like
      the sting of it again. Twos, fours, double-sixes&mdash;the gentleman&rsquo;s
      game!&rdquo; He rattled the dice and threw them with a flourish out on the
      table, his evil face lighting up. &ldquo;Come! You can&rsquo;t have something for
      nothing,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a change came over Rawley&rsquo;s face. It lost its cool
      imperturbability, it grew paler, the veins on the fine forehead stood out,
      a new, flaring light came into the eyes. The old gambler&rsquo;s spirit was
      alive. But even as it rose, sweeping him into that area of fiery
      abstraction where every nerve is strung to a fine tension, and the
      surrounding world disappears, he saw the face of Diana Welldon, he
      remembered her words to him not an hour before, and the issue of the
      conflict, other considerations apart, was without doubt. But there was her
      brother and his certain fate, if the two thousand dollars were not paid in
      by midnight. He was desperate. It was in reality for Diana&rsquo;s sake. He
      approached the table, and his old calm returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no money to play with,&rdquo; he said quietly. With a gasp of
      satisfaction, the old man fumbled in the inside of his coat and drew out
      layers of ten, fifty, and hundred-dollar bills. It was lined with them. He
      passed a pile over to Rawley&mdash;two thousand dollars. He placed a
      similar pile before himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Rawley laid his hand on the bills, the thought rushed through his mind,
      &ldquo;You have it&mdash;keep it!&rdquo; but he put it away from him. With a gentleman
      he might have done it, with this man before him, it was impossible. He
      must take his chances; and it was the only chance in which he had hope
      now, unless he appealed for humanity&rsquo;s sake, for the girl&rsquo;s sake, and told
      the real truth. It might avail. Well, that would be the last resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For small stakes?&rdquo; said the grimy quack in a gloating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rawley nodded and then added, &ldquo;We stop at eleven o&rsquo;clock, unless I&rsquo;ve lost
      or won all before that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stake what&rsquo;s left on the last throw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, in which Rawley seemed to grow older, and
      a set look came to his mouth&mdash;a broken pledge, no matter what the
      cause, brings heavy penalties to the honest mind. He shut his eyes for an
      instant, and, when he opened them, he saw that his fellow-gambler was
      watching him with an enigmatical and furtive smile. Did this Caliban have
      some understanding of what was at stake in his heart and soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play!&rdquo; Rawley said sharply, and was himself again. For hour after hour
      there was scarce a sound, save the rattle of the dice and an occasional
      exclamation from the old man as he threw a double-six. As dusk fell, the
      door had been shut, and a lighted lantern was hung over their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune had fluctuated. Once the old man&rsquo;s pile had diminished to two
      notes, then the luck had changed and his pile grew larger; then fell
      again; but, as the hands of the clock on the wall above the blue medicine
      bottles reached a quarter to eleven, it increased steadily throw after
      throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the player&rsquo;s fever was in Rawley&rsquo;s eyes. His face was deadly pale, but
      his hand threw steadily, calmly, almost negligently, as it might seem. All
      at once, at eight minutes to eleven, the luck turned in his favour, and
      his pile mounted again. Time after time he dropped double-sixes. It was
      almost uncanny. He seemed to see the dice in the box, and his hand threw
      them out with the precision of a machine. Long afterwards he had this
      vivid illusion that he could see the dice in the box. As the clock was
      about to strike eleven he had before him three thousand eight hundred
      dollars. It was his throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, and threw. He won.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gasp of relief, he got to his feet, the money in his hand. He
      stepped backward from the table, then staggered, and a faintness passed
      over him. He had sat so long without moving that his legs bent under him.
      There was a pail of water with a dipper in it on a bench. He caught up a
      dipperful of water, drank it empty, and let it fall in the pail again with
      a clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he said abstractedly, &ldquo;Dan, you&rsquo;re all safe now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he seemed to wake, as from a dream, and looked at the man at the
      table. Busby was leaning on it with both hands, and staring at Rawley like
      some animal jaded and beaten from pursuit. Rawley walked back to the table
      and laid down two thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted two thousand,&rdquo; he said, and put the other two thousand in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil eyes gloated, the long fingers clutched the pile, and swept it
      into a great inside pocket. Then the shaggy head bent forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it was for Dan,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;Dan Welldon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rawley hesitated. &ldquo;What is that to you?&rdquo; he replied at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden impulse the old impostor lurched round, opened a box, drew
      out a roll, and threw it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be known sometime,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll be my lawyer when
      I&rsquo;m put into the ground&mdash;you&rsquo;re clever. They call me a quack.
      Malpractice&mdash;bah! There&rsquo;s my diploma&mdash;James Clifton Welldon.
      Right enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rawley was petrified. He knew the forgotten story of James Clifton
      Welldon, the specialist, turned gambler, who had almost ruined his own
      brother&mdash;the father of Dan and Diana&mdash;at cards and dice, and had
      then ruined himself and disappeared. Here, where his brother had died, he
      had come years ago, and practised medicine as a quack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s plenty of proof, if it&rsquo;s wanted!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it
      here.&rdquo; He tapped the box behind him. &ldquo;Why did I do it? Because it&rsquo;s my
      way. And you&rsquo;re going to marry my niece, and &lsquo;ll have it all some day. But
      not till I&rsquo;ve finished with it&mdash;not unless you win it from me at dice
      or cards.... But no&rdquo;&mdash;something human came into the old, degenerate
      face&mdash;&ldquo;no more gambling for the man that&rsquo;s to marry Diana. There&rsquo;s a
      wonder and a beauty!&rdquo; He chuckled to himself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be rich when I&rsquo;ve
      done with it. You&rsquo;re a lucky man&mdash;ay, you&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rawley was about to tell the old man what the two thousand dollars was
      for, but a fresh wave of repugnance passed over him, and, hastily drinking
      another dipperful of water, he opened the door. He looked back. The old
      man was crouching forward, lapping milk from the great bowl, his beard
      dripping. In disgust he swung round again. The fresh, clear air caught his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gasp of relief he stepped out into the night, closing the door
      behind him.

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
