    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. IN THE DAYS OF CHILDHOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carnac! Carnac! Come and catch me, Carnac!&rdquo; It was a day of perfect
      summer and hope and happiness in the sweet, wild world behind the near
      woods and the far circle of sky and pine and hemlock. The voice that
      called was young and vibrant, and had in it the simple, true soul of
      things. It had the clearness of a bugle-call, ample and full of life and
      all life&rsquo;s possibilities. It laughed; it challenged; it decoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac heard the summons and did his best to catch the girl in the wood by
      the tumbling stream, where he had for many an hour emptied out his wayward
      heart; where he had seen his father&rsquo;s logs and timbers caught in jams,
      hunched up on rocky ledges, held by the prong of a rock, where man&rsquo;s
      purpose could, apparently, avail so little. Then he had watched the
      black-bearded river-drivers with their pike-poles and their levers loose
      the key-logs of the bunch, and the tumbling citizens of the woods and
      streams toss away down the current to the wider waters below. He was only
      a lad of fourteen, and the girl was only eight, but she&mdash;Junia&mdash;was
      as spry and graceful a being as ever woke the echoes of a forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only fourteen, but already he had visions and dreamed dreams. His
      father&mdash;John Grier&mdash;was the great lumber-king of Canada, and
      Junia was the child of a lawyer who had done little with his life, but had
      had great joy of his two daughters, who were dear to him beyond telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was one of Nature&rsquo;s freaks or accidents. He was physically strong
      and daring, but, as a boy, mentally he lacked concentration and decision,
      though very clever. He was led from thing to thing like a ray of errant
      light, and he did not put a hand on himself, as old Denzil, the partly
      deformed servant of Junia&rsquo;s home, said of him on occasion; and Denzil was
      a man of parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil was not far from the two when Junia made her appeal and challenge.
      He loved the girl exceedingly, and he loved Carnac little less, though in
      a different way. Denzil was French of the French, with habit of mind and
      character wholly his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil&rsquo;s head was squat upon his shoulders, and his long, handsome body
      was also squat, because his legs were as short, proportionately, as his
      mind was long. His face was covered by a well-cared-for beard of dark
      brown, streaked with grey; his features were rugged and fine; and his eyes
      were like two coals burning under a gnarled headland; for his forehead,
      ample and full, had lines which were not lines of age, but of
      concentration. In his motions he was quiet and free, yet always there was
      a kind of stealthiness in his movements, which made him seem less frank
      than he really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time, with salient sympathy in his eyes, he watched the two children
      playing. The whisking of their forms among the trees and over the rocks
      was fine, gracious, and full of life-life without alarm. At length he saw
      the girl falter slightly, then make a swift deceptive movement to avoid
      the boy who pursued her. The movement did not delude the boy. He had
      quickness of anticipation. An instant later the girl was in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Denzil gazed, it seemed she was in his arms too long, and a sudden
      anxiety took hold of him. That anxiety was deepened when he saw the boy
      kiss the girl on the cheek. This act seemed to discompose the girl, but
      not enough to make drama out of an innocent, yet sensuous thing. The boy
      had meant nothing more than he had shown, and Denzil traced the act to a
      native sense of luxury in his nature. Knowing the boy&rsquo;s father and mother
      as he did, it seemed strange that Carnac should have such demonstration in
      his character. Of all the women he knew, Carnac&rsquo;s mother was the most
      exact and careful, though now and again he thought of her as being
      shrouded, or apart; while the boy&rsquo;s father, the great lumber-king,
      cantankerous, passionate, perspicuous, seemed to have but one passion, and
      that was his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange to Denzil that the lumber-king, short, thin, careless in
      his clothes but singularly clean in his person, should have a son so
      little like himself, and also so little like his mother. He, Denzil, was a
      Catholic, and he could not understand a man like John Grier who, being a
      member of the Episcopal Church, so seldom went to service and so defied
      rules of conduct suitable to his place in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the girl, to him she was the seventh wonder of the earth. Wantonly
      alive, dexterously alert to all that came her way, sportive, indifferent,
      joyous, she had all the boy&rsquo;s sprightliness, but none of his weaknesses.
      She was a born tease; she loved bright and beautiful things; she was a
      keen judge of human nature, and she had buoyant spirits, which, however,
      were counterbalanced by moments of extreme timidity, or, rather, reserve
      and shyness. On a day like this, when everything in life was singing, she
      must sing too. Not a mile away was a hut by the river where her father had
      brought his family for the summer&rsquo;s fishing; not a half-mile away was a
      tent which Carnac Grier&rsquo;s father had set up as he passed northward on his
      tour of inspection. This particular river, and this particular part of the
      river, were trying to the river-man and his clans. It needed a dam, and
      the great lumber-king was planning to make one not three hundred yards
      from where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy and the girl resting idly upon a great warm rock had their own
      business to consider. The boy kept looking at his boots with the
      brass-tipped toes. He hated them. The girl was quick to understand. &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you like your boots?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whimsical, exasperated look came into his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they
      brass a boy&rsquo;s toes like that, but when I marry I won&rsquo;t wear them&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you wear them now?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got plenty of money, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Plenty; and that&rsquo;s what
      I can&rsquo;t understand about him! There&rsquo;s a lot of waste in river-driving,
      timber-making, out in the shanties and on the river, but he don&rsquo;t seem to
      mind that. He&rsquo;s got fads, though, about how we are to live, and this is
      one of them.&rdquo; He looked at the brass-tipped boots carefully. A sudden
      resolve came into his face. He turned to the girl and flushed as he spoke.
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this is the last day I&rsquo;m going to wear these
      boots. He&rsquo;s got to buy me a pair without any brass clips on them, or I&rsquo;ll
      kick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t the last day you&rsquo;re going to wear them, Carnac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. I wonder if all boys feel towards their father as I do to mine. He
      don&rsquo;t treat me right. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look,&rdquo; interrupted Junia. &ldquo;Look-Carnac!&rdquo; She pointed in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac saw a portion of the bank of the river disappear with Denzil. He
      ran over to the bank and looked down. In another moment he had made his
      way to a descending path which led him swiftly to the river&rsquo;s edge. The
      girl remained at the top. The boy had said to her: &ldquo;You stay there. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is-is he killed?&rdquo; she called with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed! No. He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he called back to her. &ldquo;I can see him move.
      Don&rsquo;t be frightened. He&rsquo;s not in the water. It was only about a
      thirty-foot fall. You stay there, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later, the boy called up: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, but his leg is
      broken. You go to my father&rsquo;s camp&mdash;it&rsquo;s near. People are sure to be
      there, and maybe father too. You bring them along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the girl was gone. The boy, left behind, busied himself in
      relieving the deformed broken-legged habitant. He brought some water in
      his straw hat to refresh him. He removed the rocks and dirt, and dragged
      the little man out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a close call&mdash;bien sur,&rdquo; said Denzil, breathing hard. &ldquo;I
      always said that place wasn&rsquo;t safe, but I went on it myself. That&rsquo;s the
      way in life. We do what we forbid ourselves to do; we suffer the shames we
      damn in others&mdash;but yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, then he added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll do in your life,
      M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you never can tell&mdash;but no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you always can tell,&rdquo; remarked the boy. &ldquo;The thing is, do what you
      feel you&rsquo;ve got to do, and never mind what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could walk,&rdquo; remarked the little man, &ldquo;but this leg of mine is
      broke&mdash;ah, bah, it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you mustn&rsquo;t try to walk. Be still,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be
      here soon.&rdquo; Slowly and carefully he took off the boot and sock from the
      broken leg, and, with his penknife, opened the seam of the corduroy
      trouser. &ldquo;I believe I could set that leg myself,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you could&mdash;bagosh,&rdquo; answered Denzil heavily. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bring
      a rope to haul me up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junia has a lot of sense, she won&rsquo;t forget anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if your father&rsquo;s there, he&rsquo;ll not forget anything,&rdquo; remarked Denzil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll forget to make me wear these boots tomorrow,&rdquo; said the boy
      stubbornly, his chin in his hands, his eyes fixed gloomily on the
      brass-headed toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. At last from the stricken Denzil came the words:
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your own way about the boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac murmured, and presently said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky you fell where you did. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d have been in the water,
      and then I couldn&rsquo;t have been of any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear them coming&mdash;holy, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac strained his ears. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I hear them too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later, Carnac&rsquo;s father came sliding down the bank, a rope in
      his hands, some workmen remaining above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A fall, eh! Dang little fool&mdash;now,
      you are a dang little fool, and you know it, Denzil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to his boy, then he raised the wounded man&rsquo;s head and shoulders,
      and slipped the noose over until it caught under his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lumber-king&rsquo;s movements were swift, sure and exact. A moment later
      he lifted Denzil in his arms, and carried him over to the steep path up
      which he was presently dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top, Denzil turned to Carnac&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, Carnac hates
      wearing those brass-toed boots,&rdquo; he said boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumber-king looked at his boy acutely. He blew his nose hard, with a
      bandana handkerchief. Then he nodded towards the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can suit himself about that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With accomplished deftness, with some sacking and two poles, a hasty but
      comfortable ambulance was made under the skilful direction of the
      river-master. He had the gift of outdoor life. He did not speak as he
      worked, but kept humming to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, as he saw Denzil on the stretcher. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get
      on home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home?&rdquo; asked his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Montreal&mdash;to-night,&rdquo; replied his father. &ldquo;The leg has to be
      set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you set it?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river-master gazed at him attentively. &ldquo;Well, I might, with your
      help,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. ELEVEN YEARS PASS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eleven years had passed since Denzil&rsquo;s fall, and in that time much history
      had been made. Carnac Grier, true to his nature, had travelled from
      incident to incident, from capacity to capacity, apparently without
      system, yet actually with the keenest desire to fulfil himself; with an
      honesty as inveterate as his looks were good and his character filled with
      dark recesses. In vain had his father endeavoured to induce him to enter
      the lumber business; to him it seemed too conventional and fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in his way, he knew the business well. By instinct, over the
      twenty-five years of his life, he had observed and become familiar with
      the main features of the work. He had once or twice even buried himself in
      the shanties of the backwoods, there to inhale and repulse the fetid air,
      to endure the untoward, half-savage life, the clean, strong food, the
      bitter animosities and the savage friendships. It was a land where
      sunshine travelled, and in the sun the bright, tuneful birds made lively
      the responsive world. Sometimes an eagle swooped down the stream; again
      and again, hawks, and flocks of pigeons which frequented the lonely groves
      on the river-side, made vocal the world of air; flocks of wild ducks, or
      geese, went whirring down the long spaces of water between the trees on
      either bank; and some one with a fiddle or a concertina made musical the
      evening, while the singing voices of rough habitants rang through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all spirited; it smelt good; it felt good; but it was not for
      Carnac. When he had a revolt against anything in life, the grim storm
      scenes of winter in the shanties under the trees and the snow-swept hills
      came to his mind&rsquo;s eye. The summer life of the river, and what is called
      &ldquo;running the river,&rdquo; had for him great charms. The smell of hundreds of
      thousands of logs in the river, the crushed bark, the slimy ooze were all
      suggestive of life in the making. But the savage seclusion of the wild
      life in winter repelled his senses. Besides, the lumber business meant
      endless figures and measurements in stuffy offices and he retreated from
      it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an artistic bent. From a small child he had had it, and it grew
      with his years. He wanted to paint, and he painted; he wanted to sculp in
      clay, and he sculped in clay; but all the time he was conscious it was the
      things he had seen and the life he had lived which made his painting and
      his sculpture worth while. It was absurd that a man of his great outdoor
      capacity should be the slave of a temperamental quality, and yet it was
      so. It was no good for his father to condemn, or his mother to mourn, he
      went his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen much of Junia Shale in these years and had grown fond of her,
      but she was away much with an aunt in the West, and she was sent to
      boarding-school, and they saw each other only at intervals. She liked him
      and showed it, but he was not ready to go farther. As yet his art was
      everything to him, and he did not think of marriage. He was care-free. He
      had a little money of his own, left by an uncle of his mother, and he had
      also an allowance from his mother&mdash;none from his father&mdash;and he
      was satisfied with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother, Fabian, being the elder, by five years, had gone into his
      father&rsquo;s business as a partner, and had remained there. Fabian had at last
      married an elder sister of Junia Shale and settled down in a house on the
      hill, and the lumber-king, John Grier, went on building up his splendid
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Carnac, feeling he was making small headway with his painting,
      determined to go again to New York and Paris. He had already spent a year
      in each place and it had benefited him greatly. So, with that sudden
      decision which marked his life, he started for New York. It was
      immediately after the New Year and the ground was covered with snow. He
      looked out of the window of the train, and there was only the long line of
      white country broken by the leafless trees and rail-fences and the
      mansard-roofs and low cottages with their stoops, built up with earth to
      keep them warm; and the sheds full of cattle; and here and there a sawmill
      going hard, and factories pounding away and men in fur coats driving the
      small Indian ponies; and the sharp calls of the men with the sleigh
      bringing wood, or meat, or vegetables to market. He was by nature a queer
      compound of Radical and Conservative, a victim of vision and temperament.
      He was full of pride, yet fuller of humility of a real kind. As he left
      Montreal he thought of Junia Shale, and he recalled the day eleven years
      before when he had worn brass-toed boots, and he had caught Junia in his
      arms and kissed her, and Denzil had had his accident. Denzil had got
      unreasonably old since then; but Junia remained as she was the joyous day
      when boyhood took on the first dreams of manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was a queer thing, and he had not yet got his bearings in it. He had
      a desire to reform the world and he wanted to be a great painter or
      sculptor, or both; and he entered New York with a new sense developed. He
      was keen to see, to do, and to feel. He wanted to make the world ring with
      his name and fame, yet he wanted to do the world good also, if he could.
      It was a curious state of mind for the English boy, who talked French like
      a native and loved French literature and the French people, and was angry
      with those English-Canadians who were so selfish they would never learn
      French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in New York he took lodgings near old Washington Square, where
      there were a few studios near the Bohemian restaurants and a life as
      nearly continental as was possible in a new country. He got in touch with
      a few artists and began to paint, doing little scenes in the Bowery and of
      the night-life of New York, and visiting the Hudson River and Long Island
      for landscape and seascape sketches.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he was going down Broadway, and near Union Square he saved a girl
      from being killed by a street-car. She had slipped and fallen on the track
      and a car was coming. It was impossible for her to get away in time, and
      Carnac had sprung to her and got her free. She staggered to her feet, and
      he saw she was beautiful and foreign. He spoke to her in French and her
      eyes lighted, for she was French. She told him at once that her name was
      Luzanne Larue. He offered to get a cab and take her home, but she said no,
      she was fit to walk, so he went with her slowly to her home in one of the
      poor streets on the East side. They talked as they went, and Carnac saw
      she was of the lower middle-class, with more refinement than was common in
      that class, and more charm. She was a fascinating girl with fine black
      eyes, black hair, a complexion of cream, and a gift of the tongue. Carnac
      could not see that she was very subtle. She seemed a marvel of
      guilelessness. She had a wonderful head and neck, and as he was planning a
      picture of an early female martyr, he decided to ask her to sit to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at her humble home, he was asked to enter, and there he met her
      father, Isel Larue, a French monarchist who had been exiled from Paris for
      plotting against the Government. He was handsome with snapping black eyes,
      a cruel mouth and a droll and humorous tongue. He was grateful to Carnac
      for saving his daughter&rsquo;s life. Coffee and cigarettes were produced, and
      they chatted and smoked while Carnac took in the surroundings. Everything
      was plain, but spotlessly clean, and he learned that Larue made his living
      by doing odd jobs in an electric firm. He was just home from his work.
      Luzanne was employed every afternoon in a milliner&rsquo;s shop, but her
      evenings were free after the housework was done at nine o&rsquo;clock. Carnac in
      a burst of enthusiasm asked if she would sit to him as a model in the
      mornings. Her father instantly said, of course she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      This she did for many days, and sat with her hair down and bared neck, as
      handsome and modest as a female martyr should. Carnac painted her with
      skill. Sometimes he would walk with her to lunch and make her eat
      something sustaining, and they talked freely then, though little was said
      while he was painting her. At last one day the painting was finished, and
      she looked up at him wistfully when he told her he would not need another
      sitting. Carnac, overcome by her sadness, put his arms round her and
      kissed her mouth, her eyes, her neck ravenously. She made only a slight
      show of resistance. When he stopped she said: &ldquo;Is that the way you keep
      your word to my father? I am here alone and you embrace me&mdash;is that
      fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t, and I promise I won&rsquo;t do it again, Luzanne. I am sorry. I
      wanted our friendship to benefit us both, and now I&rsquo;ve spoiled it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t spoiled it all,&rdquo; said Luzanne with a sigh, and she
      buttoned up the neck of her blouse, flushing slightly as she did so. Her
      breast heaved and suddenly she burst into tears. It was evident she wanted
      Carnac to comfort her, perhaps to kiss her again, but he did not do so. He
      only stood over her, murmuring penance and asking her to forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. No man but my father has ever kissed me
      before. It makes me, oh! so miserable!&rdquo; but she smiled through her tears.
      Suddenly she dried her eyes. &ldquo;Once a man tried to kiss me&mdash;and
      something more. He was rich and he&rsquo;d put money into Madame Margot&rsquo;s
      millinery business. He was brilliant, and married, but he had no rules for
      his morals&mdash;all he wanted was money and pleasures which he bought. I
      was attracted by him, but one day he tried to kiss me. I slapped his face,
      and then I hated him. So, when you kissed me to-day, I thought of that,
      and it made me unhappy&mdash;but yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not slap my face, Luzanne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed and hung her head. &ldquo;No, I did not; you are not a bad man. He
      would have spoiled my life. He made it clear I could have all the luxuries
      money could buy&mdash;all except marriage!&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was of an impressionable nature, but brought to face the
      possibility of marriage with Luzanne, he shrank. If ever he married it
      would be a girl like Junia Shale, beautiful, modest, clever and well
      educated. No, Luzanne could never be for him. So he forbore doing more
      than ask her to forgive him, and he would take her to lunch-the last lunch
      of the picture-if she would. With features in chagrin, she put on her hat,
      yet when she turned to him, she was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He visited her home occasionally, and Luzanne&rsquo;s father had a friend, Ingot
      by name, who was sometimes present. This man made himself almost
      unbearable at first; but Luzanne pulled Ingot up acridly, and he presently
      behaved well. Ingot disliked all men in better positions than himself, and
      was a revolutionary of the worst sort&mdash;a revolutionary and
      monarchist. He was only a monarchist because he loved conspiracy and hated
      the Republican rulers who had imprisoned him&mdash;&ldquo;those bombastics,&rdquo; he
      called them. It was a constitutional quarrel with the world. However, he
      became tractable, and then he and Larue formed a plot to make Carnac marry
      Luzanne. It was hatched by Ingot, approved by Larue, and at length
      consented to by the girl, for so far as she could love anyone, she loved
      Carnac; and she made up her mind that if he married her, no matter how,
      she would make him so happy he would forgive all.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four months after the incident in the studio, a picnic was arranged
      for the Hudson River. Only the four went. Carnac had just sold a picture
      at a good price&mdash;his Christian Martyr picture&mdash;and he was in
      high spirits. They arrived at the spot arranged for the picnic in time for
      lunch, and Luzanne prepared it. When the lunch was ready, they sat down.
      There was much gay talk, compliments to Carnac came from both Larue and
      Ingot, and Carnac was excited and buoyant. He drank much wine and beer,
      and told amusing stories of the French-Canadians which delighted them all.
      He had a gift of mimicry and he let himself go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got a pretty fine tongue in your head&mdash;but of the best,&rdquo; said
      Ingot with a burst of applause. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a good actor, a holy good
      actor. You got a way with you. Coquelin, Salvini, Bernhardt! Voila, you&rsquo;re
      just as good! Bagosh, I&rsquo;d like to see you on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Larue. &ldquo;I think you could play a house full in no time
      and make much cash&mdash;I think you could. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Luzanne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luzanne laughed. &ldquo;He can act very first-class, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said, and
      she turned and looked Carnac in the eyes. She was excited, she was
      handsome, she was slim and graceful, and Carnac felt towards her as he did
      the day at the studio, as though he&rsquo;d like to kiss her. He knew it was not
      real, but it was the man in him and the sex in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour and a half the lunch went on, all growing gayer, and then at
      last Ingot said: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to have a play now here, and Carnac
      Grier shall act, and we all shall act. We&rsquo;re going to have a wedding
      ceremony between M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Grier and Luzanne&mdash;but, hush, why not!&rdquo; he
      added, when Luzanne shook her finger at him, and said she&rsquo;d do nothing of
      the kind, having, however, agreed to it beforehand. &ldquo;Why not! There&rsquo;s
      nothing in it. They&rsquo;ll both be married some day and it will be good
      practice for them. They can learn now how to do it. It&rsquo;s got to be done&mdash;but
      yes. I&rsquo;ll find a Judge in the village. Come now, hands up, those that will
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a loud laugh Larue held up his hand, Carnac, who was half-drunk, did
      the same, and after a little hesitation Luzanne also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;a gay little comedy, that&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;m off for the
      Judge,&rdquo; and away went Ingot hard afoot, having already engaged a Judge,
      called Grimshaw, in the village near to perform the ceremony. When he had
      gone, Larue went off to smoke and Luzanne and Carnac cleared up the
      lunch-things and put all away in the baskets. When it was finished, Carnac
      and Luzanne sat down under a tree and talked cheerfully, and Luzanne was
      never so effective as she was that day. They laughed over the mock
      ceremony to be performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Catholic, you know,&rdquo; said Luzanne, &ldquo;and it isn&rsquo;t legal in my church
      with no dispensation to be married to a Protestant like you. But as it is,
      what does it matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be acting the
      lover now; I ought to be kissing you, oughtn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an actor, yes, but as a man, better not unless others are present.
      Wait till the others come. Wait for witnesses, so that it can look like
      the real thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, there they come now.&rdquo; She pointed, and in the near distance Ingot
      could be seen approaching with a short, clean-shaven, roly-poly sort of
      man who did not look legal, but was a real magistrate. He came waddling
      along in good spirits and rather pompously. At that moment Larue appeared.
      Presently Ingot presented the Judge to the would&mdash;be bride and
      bridegroom. &ldquo;You wish to be married-you are Mr. Grier?&rdquo; said Judge
      Grimshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me and I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;Get on with the show. What&rsquo;s the
      first thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the regular thing is to sign some forms, stating age, residence,
      etc., and here they are all ready. Brought &lsquo;em along with me. Most unusual
      form of ceremony, but it&rsquo;ll do. It&rsquo;s all right. Here are the papers to
      sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac hastily scratched in the needed information, and Luzanne doing the
      same, the magistrate pocketed the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we can perform the ceremony,&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;Mr. Larue, you go down
      there with the young lady and bring her up in form, and Mr. Carnac Grier
      waits here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larue went away with Luzanne, and presently turned, and she, with her arm
      in his, came forward. Carnac stood waiting with a smile on his face, for
      it seemed good acting. When Luzanne came, her father handed her over, and
      the marriage ceremony proceeded. Presently it concluded, and Grimshaw, who
      had had more drink than was good for him, wound up the ceremony with the
      words: &ldquo;And may the Lord have mercy on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one laughed, Carnac kissed the bride, and the Judge handed her the
      marriage certificate duly signed. It was now Carnac&rsquo;s duty to pay in the
      usual way for the ceremony, and he handed the Judge ten dollars; and
      Grimshaw rolled away towards the village, Ingot having also given him ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as good a piece of acting as I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; said Larue with a
      grin. &ldquo;It beats Coquelin and Henry Irving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think there was much in it,&rdquo; said Carnac, laughing, &ldquo;though it
      was real enough to cost me ten dollars. One has to pay for one&rsquo;s fun. But
      I got a wife cheap at the price, and I didn&rsquo;t pay for the wedding ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the ring was mine,&rdquo; said Larue. &ldquo;I had it a long time. It was my
      engagement ring, and I want it back now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luzanne took it off her finger&mdash;it was much too large&mdash;and gave
      it to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to get another,&rdquo; she said in a queer voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did the thing in style, young man,&rdquo; said Ingot to Carnac with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it better when it&rsquo;s the real thing,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my
      rehearsal now, and it seemed almost real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was almost real,&rdquo; said Ingot, with his head turned away from Carnac,
      but he winked at Larue and caught a furtive look from Luzanne&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better have another hour hereabouts, then get back to New
      York,&rdquo; said Larue. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a circus in the village&mdash;let us go to
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the village, they did the circus, called out praise to the clown, gave
      the elephant some buns, and at five o&rsquo;clock started back to New York.
      Arrived at New York, they went to a hotel off Broadway for dinner, and
      Carnac signed names in the hotel register as &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Carnac Grier.&rdquo;
       When he did it, he saw a furtive glance pass from Luzanne&rsquo;s eyes to her
      father. It was disconcerting to him. Presently the two adjourned to the
      sitting-room, and there he saw that the table was only laid for two. That
      opened his eyes. The men had disappeared and he and Luzanne were alone.
      She was sitting on a sofa near the table, showing to good advantage. She
      was composed, while Carnac was embarrassed. Carnac began to take a grip on
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter entered. &ldquo;When shall I serve dinner, sir?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac realized that the dinner had been ordered by the two men, and he
      said quietly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t serve it for a half-hour yet&mdash;not till I ring,
      please. Make it ready then. There&rsquo;s no hurry. It&rsquo;s early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter bowed and withdrew with a smile, and Carnac turned to Luzanne.
      She smiled, got up, came over, laid a hand on his arm, and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      quiet and nice here, Carnac dear,&rdquo; and she looked up ravishingly in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too quiet and it&rsquo;s not at all nice,&rdquo; he suddenly replied. &ldquo;Your
      father and Ingot have gone. They&rsquo;ve left us alone on purpose. This is a
      dirty game and I&rsquo;m not going to play it any longer. I&rsquo;ve had enough of it.
      I&rsquo;ve had my fill. I&rsquo;m going now. Come, let&rsquo;s go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked a bit smashed and overdone. &ldquo;The dinner!&rdquo; she said in
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for that. We won&rsquo;t wait any longer. Come on at once, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put on her things coolly, and he noticed a savage stealthiness as she
      pushed the long pins through her hat and hair. He left the room. Outside
      the hotel, Carnac held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night and good-bye, Luzanne,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;You can get home
      alone, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little, then she said: &ldquo;I guess so. I&rsquo;ve lived in New York
      some years. But you and I are married, Carnac, and you ought to take me to
      your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something devilish in her smile now. Then the whole truth burst
      upon Carnac. &ldquo;Married&mdash;married! When did I marry you? Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You married me this afternoon after lunch at Shipton. I have the
      certificate and I mean to hold you to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to hold me to it&mdash;a real marriage to-day at Shipton! You
      and your father and Ingot tricked me into this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a real Judge, and it was a real marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fraud, and I&rsquo;ll unmask it,&rdquo; Carnac declared in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be difficult to prove. You signed our names in the hotel
      register as Mr. and Mrs. Carnac Grier. I mean to stick to that name&mdash;Mrs.
      Carnac Grier. I&rsquo;ll make you a good wife, Carnac&mdash;do believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe nothing but the worst of you ever. I&rsquo;ll fight the thing out,
      by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and smiled. &ldquo;I meant you to marry me, when you saved my
      life from the streetcar. I never saw but one man I wanted to marry, and
      you are that man, Carnac. You wouldn&rsquo;t ask me, so I made you marry me. You
      could go farther and fare worse. Come, take me home&mdash;take me home, my
      love. I want you to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little devil!&rdquo; Carnac declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather cut my own throat. I&rsquo;m
      going to have a divorce. I&rsquo;m going to teach you and the others a lesson
      you won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a jury in the United States you could convince after what
      you&rsquo;ve done. You&rsquo;ve made it impossible. Go to Judge Grimshaw and see what
      he will say. Go and ask the hotel people and see what they will say.
      You&rsquo;re my husband, and I mean you shall live with me, and I&rsquo;ll love you
      better than any woman on earth can love you.... Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She held out
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an angry exclamation, Carnac refused it, and then she suddenly turned
      on her heel, slipped round a corner and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was dumbfounded. He did not know what to do. He went dazedly home,
      and slept little that night. The next day he went out to Shipton and saw
      Judge Grimshaw and told him the whole tale. The Judge shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too tall a story. Why, you went through the ceremony as if it was
      the real thing, signed the papers, paid my fee, and kissed the bride. You
      could not get a divorce on such evidence. I&rsquo;m sorry for you, if you don&rsquo;t
      want the girl. She&rsquo;s very nice, and &lsquo;d make a good wife. What does she
      mean to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She left me in the street and went back to her home. I
      won&rsquo;t live with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you anyhow. She has the certificate. You are validly
      married. If I were you, I&rsquo;d let the matter stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they parted, and Carnac sullenly went back to his apartments. The next
      day he went to see a lawyer, however. The lawyer opened his eyes at the
      story. He had never heard anything like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound as if you were sober when you did it. Were you, sir? It
      was a mad prank, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had been drinking, but I wasn&rsquo;t drunk. I&rsquo;d been telling them stories
      and they used them as a means of tempting me to act in the absurd marriage
      ceremony. Like a fool I consented. Like a fool&mdash;but I wasn&rsquo;t drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but when you were in your right mind and sober you signed your names
      as Mr. and Mrs. Carnac Grier in the register of a hotel. I will try to win
      your case for you, but it won&rsquo;t be easy work. You see the Judge himself
      told you the same thing. But it would be a triumph to expose a thing of
      that kind, and I&rsquo;d like to do it. It wouldn&rsquo;t be cheap, though. You&rsquo;d have
      to foot the bill. Are you rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but my people are,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;I could manage the cash, but
      suppose I lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d have to support the woman. She could sue you for cruelty and
      desertion, and the damages would be heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac shook his head, paid his fee and left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go near Luzanne. After a month he went to Paris for eight
      months, and then back to Montreal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. CARNAC&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arrived in Montreal, there were attempts by Carnac to settle down to
      ordinary life of quiet work at his art, but it was not effective, nor had
      it been in Paris, though the excitement of working in the great centre had
      stimulated him. He ever kept saying to himself, &ldquo;Carnac, you are a married
      man&mdash;a married man, by the tricks of rogues!&rdquo; In Paris, he could more
      easily obscure it, but in Montreal, a few hundred miles from the place of
      his tragedy, pessimism seized him. He now repented he did not fight it out
      at once. It would have been courageous and perhaps successful. But whether
      successful or not, he would have put himself right with his own
      conscience. That was the chief thing. He was straightforward, and back
      again in Canada, Carnac flung reproaches at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew himself now to be in love with Junia Shale, and because he was
      married he could not approach her. It galled him. He was not fond of
      Fabian, for they had little in common, and he had no intimate friends.
      Only his mother was always sympathetic to him, and he loved her. He saw
      much of her, but little of anyone else. He belonged to no clubs, and there
      were few artists in Montreal. So he lived his own life, and when he met
      Junia he cavilled at himself for his madness with Luzanne. The curious
      thing was he had not had a word from her since the day of the mock
      marriage. Perhaps she had decided to abandon the thing! But that could do
      no good, for there was the marriage recorded in the registers of New York
      State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, things were not going well with others. There befell a day when
      matters came to a crisis in the Grier family. Since Fabian&rsquo;s marriage with
      Junia Shale&rsquo;s sister, Sybil, he had become discontented with his position
      in his father&rsquo;s firm. There was little love between him and his father,
      and that was chiefly the father&rsquo;s fault. One day, the old man stormed at
      Fabian because of a mistake in the management, and was foolish enough to
      say that Fabian had lost his grip since his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabian, enraged, demanded freedom from the partnership, and offered to
      sell his share. In a fit of anger, the old man offered him what was at
      least ten per cent more than the value of Fabian&rsquo;s share. The sombre
      Fabian had the offer transferred to paper at once, and it was signed by
      his father&mdash;not without compunction, because difficult as Fabian was
      he might go further and fare worse. As for Fabian&rsquo;s dark-haired,
      brown-faced, brown-eyed wife, to John Grier&rsquo;s mind, it seemed a good thing
      to be rid of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fabian left the father alone in his office, however, the stark temper
      of the old man broke down. He had had enough. He muttered to himself.
      Presently he was roused by a little knock at the door. It was Junia,
      brilliant, buoyant, yellow haired, with bright brown eyes, tingling
      cheeks, and white laughing teeth that showed against her red lips. She
      held up a finger at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;ve done, and it&rsquo;s no good at all. You can&rsquo;t live without
      us, and you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. The old man glowered still, but a
      reflective smile crawled to his lips. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s finished,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to come, and it&rsquo;s done. It can&rsquo;t be changed. Fabian wouldn&rsquo;t alter
      it, and I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was stern and dour. He tangled his short fingers in the hair on
      top of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that, if I were you,&rdquo; she responded cheerily. &ldquo;Fabian
      showed me the sum you offered for his share. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. The business
      isn&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about the business?&rdquo; remarked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever it was worth an hour ago, it&rsquo;s worth less now,&rdquo; she
      answered with suggestion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth much less now,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; he asked sharply, sitting upright, his hands
      clasping his knees almost violently, his clean-shaven face showing lines
      of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean he&rsquo;s going to join the enemy,&rdquo; she answered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join the enemy!&rdquo; broke from the old man&rsquo;s lips with a startled accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the firm of Belloc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man did not speak, but a curious whiteness stole over his face.
      &ldquo;What makes you say that!&rdquo; he exclaimed, anger in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fabian has to put money into something,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and the
      only business he knows is lumber business. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s natural he
      should go to Belloc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever say so?&rdquo; asked the old man with savage sullenness. &ldquo;Tell me.
      Did he ever say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook back her brave head with a laugh. &ldquo;Of course he never said
      so, but I know the way he&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. He&rsquo;s got no love for
      Belloc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl felt like saying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no love for you,&rdquo; but she refrained.
      She knew that Fabian had love for his father, but he had inherited a love
      for business, and that would overwhelm all other feelings. She therefore
      said: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get Carnac to come in? He&rsquo;s got more sense than
      Fabian&mdash;and he isn&rsquo;t married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke boldly, for she knew the character of the man. She was only
      nineteen. She had always come in and gone out of Grier&rsquo;s house and office
      freely and much more since her sister had married Fabian.
    </p>
    <p>
      A storm gathered between the old man&rsquo;s eyes; his brow knitted. &ldquo;Carnac&rsquo;s
      got brains enough, but he goes monkeying about with pictures and statues
      till he&rsquo;s worth naught in the business of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand him,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to
      understand him for twenty-five years,&rdquo; the other said malevolently. &ldquo;He
      might have been a big man. He might have bossed this business when I&rsquo;m
      gone. It&rsquo;s in him, but he&rsquo;s a fly-away&mdash;he&rsquo;s got no sense. The ideas
      he&rsquo;s got make me sick. He talks like a damn fool sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he&rsquo;s a &lsquo;damn fool&rsquo;&mdash;is it strange?&rdquo; She gaily tossed a kiss
      at the king of the lumber world. &ldquo;The difference between you and him is
      this: he doesn&rsquo;t care about the things of this world, and you do; but he&rsquo;s
      one of the ablest men in Canada. If Fabian won&rsquo;t come back, why not
      Carnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never hit it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stood up, his face flushed, his hands outthrust themselves in
      rage, his fingers opened and shut in abandonment of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have I two such sons!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been bad. I&rsquo;ve
      squeezed a few; I&rsquo;ve struck here and there; I&rsquo;ve mauled my enemies, but
      I&rsquo;ve been good to my own. Why can&rsquo;t I run square with my own family?&rdquo; He
      was purple to the roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savagery possessed him. Life was testing him to the nth degree. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      a good father, and a good husband! Why am I treated like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched him silently. Presently, however, the storm seemed to pass. He
      appeared to gain control of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to have in Carnac?&rdquo; he asked, with a little fleck of foam at
      the corners of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could have Fabian back,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s been
      coming for a long time. He&rsquo;s got your I.O.U. and he won&rsquo;t return; but
      Carnac&rsquo;s got plenty of stuff in him. He never was afraid of anything or
      anybody, and if he took a notion, he could do this business as well as
      yourself by and by. It&rsquo;s all a chance, but if he comes in he&rsquo;ll put
      everything else aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; the old man asked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s with his mother at your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man took his hat from the window-sill. At that moment a clerk
      appeared with some papers. &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked Grier sharply.
      &ldquo;The Belloc account for the trouble on the river,&rdquo; answered the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; Grier said, and he waved the clerk away. Then he glanced at
      the account, and a grim smile passed over his face. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have all
      they want, and they won&rsquo;t get it. Are you coming with me?&rdquo; he asked of the
      girl, with a set look in his eyes. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going back to my sister,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he leaves me&mdash;if he joins Belloc!&rdquo; the old man muttered, and
      again his face flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments afterwards the girl watched him till he disappeared up the
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Carnac will do it,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the
      sense, the brains, and the energy; but he won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard a voice behind her, and turned. It was the deformed but potent
      Denzil. He was greyer now. His head, a little to one side, seemed sunk in
      his square shoulders, but his eyes were bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a bad scrape&mdash;that about Fabian Grier,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
      ever tell about such things, how they&rsquo;ll go&mdash;but no, bagosh!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Grier&rsquo;s house had a porch with Corinthian pillars. Its elevation was
      noble, but it was rather crudely built, and it needed its grove of maples
      to make it pleasant to the eye. It was large but not too ample, and it had
      certain rooms with distinct character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the house, John Grier paused a moment before the door of the
      sitting-room where his wife usually sat. All was silent. He opened the
      door. A woman rose to meet him. She was dressed in black. Her dark hair,
      slightly streaked with grey, gave her distinction. Her eyes had soft
      understanding; her lips had a reflective smile. There was, however,
      uneasiness in her face; her fingers slightly trembled on the linen she was
      holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re home early, John,&rdquo; she said in a gentle, reserved voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He twisted a shoulder. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m home early,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Your boy Fabian
      has left the business, and I&rsquo;ve bought his share.&rdquo; He named the sum.
      &ldquo;Ghastly, ain&rsquo;t it? But he&rsquo;s gone, and there&rsquo;s no more about it. It&rsquo;s a
      bad thing to marry a woman that can&rsquo;t play fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He noted the excessive paleness of his wife&rsquo;s face; the bright eyes stared
      and stared, and the lips trembled. &ldquo;Fabian&mdash;Fabian gone!&rdquo; she said
      brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he ain&rsquo;t coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he going to do?&rdquo; she asked in a bitter voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join Belloc&mdash;fight his own father&mdash;try to do me in the race,&rdquo;
       growled the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junia, she told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she know about it? Who told her that?&rdquo; asked the woman with
      faded lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always had sense, that child. I wish she was a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly ground his heel, and there was distemper in face and voice;
      his shoulders hunched; his hands were thrust down in his pockets. He
      wheeled on her. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your other boy? Where&rsquo;s Carnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman pointed to the lawn. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s catching a bit of the city from the
      hill just beyond the pear-tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Painting, eh? I heard he was here. I want to talk to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will do any good,&rdquo; was the sad reply. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t think
      as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe he&rsquo;s a genius,&rdquo; snarled the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I wish you luck,&rdquo; she said, but there was no conviction in
      her tone. Truth was, she did not wish him luck in this. She watched him
      leave by the French window and stride across the lawn. A strange, troubled
      expression was in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t pull it off together,&rdquo; she said to herself, and Carnac is too
      full of independence. He wants nothing from anybody. He needs no one; he
      follows no one&mdash;except me. Yes, he follows&mdash;he loves me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched her husband till he almost viciously thrust aside the bushes
      staying his progress, and broke into the space by the pear-tree where
      Carnac sat with palette and brush, gazing at the distant roofs on which
      the sun was leaving its last kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac got to his feet with a smile, and with a courage in his eye equal
      to that which had ever been in his father&rsquo;s face&mdash;in the face of John
      Grier. It was strange that the other&rsquo;s presence troubled him, that even as
      a small child, to be in the same room for any length of time vexed him.
      Much of that had passed away. The independence of the life he lived, the
      freedom from resting upon the financial will of the lumber king had given
      him light, air and confidence. He loved his mother. What he felt for John
      Grier was respect and admiration. He knew he was not spoken to now with
      any indolent purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had seen little of each other of late years. His mother had given him
      the money to go to New York and Paris, which helped out his own limited
      income. He wondered what should bring his father to him now. There was
      interested reflection in his eye. With his habit of visualization, he saw
      behind John Grier, as he came on now, the long procession of logs and
      timbers which had made his fortune, stretch back on the broad St.
      Lawrence, from the Mattawan to the Madawaska, from the Richelieu to the
      Marmora. Yet, what was it John Grier had done? In a narrow field he had
      organized his life perfectly, had developed his opportunities, had
      safeguarded his every move. The smiling inquiry in his face was answered
      by the old man saying abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fabian&rsquo;s gone. He&rsquo;s deserted the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had the wish to say in reply, &ldquo;At last, eh!&rdquo; but he avoided
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought him out to-day, and I hear he&rsquo;s going to join Belloc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belloc! Belloc! Who told you that?&rdquo; asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junia Shale&mdash;she told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughed. &ldquo;She knows a lot, but how did she know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheer instinct, and I believe she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right&mdash;right&mdash;to fight you, his own father!&rdquo; was the
      inflammable reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that would be a lowdown business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be lower down than your not helping your father, when you can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow he yearned over his wayward, fantastic son. The wilful, splendid
      character of the youth overcame the insistence in the other&rsquo;s nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be getting on all right,&rdquo; remarked Carnac with the faint
      brown moustache, the fine, showy teeth, the clean-shaven cheeks, and
      auburn hair hanging loosely down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. Things aren&rsquo;t doing as well with me as they might. Belloc
      and the others make difficult going. I&rsquo;ve got too much to do myself. I
      want help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had it in Fabian,&rdquo; remarked Carnac dryly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve lost it, and it
      never was enough. He hadn&rsquo;t vision, sense and decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you come to me, eh? I always thought you despised me,&rdquo; said
      Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-tender, half-repellent expression came into the old man&rsquo;s face. He
      spoke bluntly. &ldquo;I always thought you had three times the brains of your
      brother. You&rsquo;re not like me, and you&rsquo;re not like your mother; there&rsquo;s
      something in you that means vision, and seeing things, and doing them. If
      fifteen thousand dollars a year and a share in the business is any good to
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant there had been pleasure and wonder in the young man&rsquo;s eyes,
      but at the sound of the money and the share in the business he shrank
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, father. I&rsquo;m happy enough. I&rsquo;ve got all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you talking about!&rdquo; the other burst out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
      all you want! You&rsquo;ve no home; you&rsquo;ve no wife; you&rsquo;ve no children; you&rsquo;ve
      no place. You paint, and you sculp, and what&rsquo;s the good of it all? Have
      you ever thought of that? What&rsquo;s there in it for you or anyone else? Have
      you no blood and bones, no sting of life in you? Look what I&rsquo;ve done. I
      started with little, and I&rsquo;ve built up a business that, if it goes all
      right, will be worth millions. I say, if it goes all right, because I&rsquo;ve
      got to carry more than I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac shook his head. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be any help to you. I&rsquo;m not a man of
      action. I think, I devise, but I don&rsquo;t act. I&rsquo;d be no good in your
      business no, honestly, I&rsquo;d be no good. I don&rsquo;t think money is the end of
      life. I don&rsquo;t think success is compensation for all you&rsquo;ve done and still
      must do. I want to stand out of it. You&rsquo;ve had your life; you&rsquo;ve lived it
      where you wanted to live it. I haven&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m trying to find out where
      my duty and my labour lies. It is Art; no doubt. I don&rsquo;t know for sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; broke in the old man. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know for sure&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      twenty-five years old, and you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know where I&rsquo;m going&mdash;to Heaven by and by!&rdquo; This was his
      satirical reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fasten down; get hold of something that matters. Now, listen to me. I
      want you to do one thing&mdash;the thing I ought to do and can&rsquo;t. I must
      stay here now that Fabian&rsquo;s gone. I want you to go to the Madawaska
      River.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t go to the Madawaska,&rdquo; replied Carnac after a long pause,
      &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;with sudden resolution&mdash;&ldquo;if it&rsquo;s any good to you, I&rsquo;ll
      stay here in the business, and you can go to the Madawaska. Show me what
      to do here; tell me how to do it, and I&rsquo;ll try to help you out for a while&mdash;if
      it can be done,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;You go, but I&rsquo;ll stay. Let&rsquo;s talk it
      over at supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and turned and gazed warmly at the sunset on the roofs of the
      city; then turned to his father&rsquo;s face, but it was not the same look in
      his eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. CARNAC AS MANAGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Carnac was installed in the office, and John Grier went to the Madawaska.
      Before he left, however, he was with Carnac for near a week, showing the
      procedure and the main questions that might arise to be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Grier in their last talk, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to keep a
      stiff hand over the foremen and overseers, and have strict watch of Belloc
      &amp; Co. Perhaps there will be trouble when I&rsquo;ve gone, but, if it does,
      keep a stiff upper lip, and don&rsquo;t let the gang do you. You&rsquo;ve got a quick
      mind and you know how to act sudden. Act at once, and damn the
      consequences! Remember, John Grier&rsquo;s firm has a reputation, and deal
      justly, but firmly, with opposition. The way it&rsquo;s organized, the business
      almost runs itself. But that&rsquo;s only when the man at the head keeps his
      finger on the piston-rod. You savvy, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I savvy all right. If the Belloc firm cuts up rusty, I&rsquo;ll think of what
      you&rsquo;d do and try to do it in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled. He liked the spirit in Carnac. It was the right kind
      for his business. &ldquo;I predict this: if you have one fight with the Belloc
      lot, you&rsquo;ll hate them too. Keep the flag flying. Don&rsquo;t get rattled. It&rsquo;s a
      big job, and it&rsquo;s worth doing in a big way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a big job,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll pull it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pull it off, if you bend your mind to it. But there won&rsquo;t be any
      time for your little pictures and statues. You&rsquo;ll have to deal with the
      real men, and they&rsquo;ll lose their glamour. That&rsquo;s the thing about business&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      death to sentimentality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac flushed with indignation. &ldquo;So you think Titian and Velasquez and
      Goyot and El Greco and Watteau and Van Dyck and Rembrandt and all the rest
      were sentimentalists, do you? The biggest men in the world worship them.
      You aren&rsquo;t just to the greatest intellects. I suppose Shakespeare was a
      sentimentalist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man laughed and tapped his son on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, Carnac. I&rsquo;d rather you ran my business well, than be
      Titian or Rembrandt, whoever they were. If you do this job well, I&rsquo;ll
      think there&rsquo;s a good chance of our working together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac nodded, but the thought that he could not paint or sculp when he
      was on this work vexed him, and he only set his teeth to see it through.
      &ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he said, and his father went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Carnac&rsquo;s time of work and trial began. He was familiar with the
      routine of the business, he had adaptability, he was a quick worker, and
      for a fortnight things went swimmingly. There was elation in doing work
      not his regular job, and he knew the eyes of the commercial and river
      world were on him. He did his best and it was an effective best. Junia had
      been in the City of Quebec, but she came back at the end of a fortnight,
      and went to his office to get a subscription for a local charity. She had
      a gift in this kind of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sunny day in the month of June, and as she entered the office a
      new spirit seemed to enter with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place became distinguished. She stood in the doorway for a moment,
      radiant, smiling, half embarrassed, then she said: &ldquo;Please may I for a
      moment, Carnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was delighted. &ldquo;For many moments, Junia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as busy as usual. I&rsquo;m glad as glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said with restraint: &ldquo;Not for many moments. I&rsquo;m here on business. It&rsquo;s
      important. I wanted to get a subscription from John Grier for the Sailors&rsquo; 
      Hospital which is in a bad way. Will you give something for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac looked at the subscription list. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve been to Belloc first
      and they&rsquo;ve given a hundred dollars. Was that wise-going to them first?
      You know how my father feels about Belloc. And we&rsquo;re the older firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s silly! Belloc&rsquo;s money is as good as John
      Grier&rsquo;s, and it only happened he was asked first because Fabian was
      present when I took the list, and it&rsquo;s Fabian&rsquo;s writing on the paper
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right with me, for I&rsquo;m no foe to Belloc, but my
      father wouldn&rsquo;t have liked it. He wouldn&rsquo;t have given anything in the
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he would! He&rsquo;s got sense with all his prejudices. I&rsquo;ll tell you
      what he&rsquo;d have done: he&rsquo;d have given a bigger subscription than Belloc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughed. &ldquo;Well, perhaps you&rsquo;re right; it was clever planning it
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t plan it. It was accident, but I had to consider everything and I
      saw how to turn it to account. So, if you are going to give a subscription
      for John Grier you must do as he would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac smiled, put the paper on his desk, and took the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it measure the hate John Grier has to the Belloc firm,&rdquo; she said
      ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac chuckled and wrote. &ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo; He handed her the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and fifty dollars&mdash;oh, quite, quite good!&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only a half hatred after all. I&rsquo;d have made it a whole one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have expected John Grier to give two hundred, eh? But that would
      have been too plain. It looks all right now, and it must go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll go at that. You&rsquo;re a good business man. I see
      you&rsquo;ve given up your painting and sculping to do this! It will please your
      father, but are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied&mdash;of course, I&rsquo;m not; and you know it. I&rsquo;m not a
      money-grabber. I&rsquo;m an artist if I&rsquo;m anything, and I&rsquo;m not doing this
      permanently. I&rsquo;m only helping my father while he&rsquo;s in a hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl suddenly grew serious. &ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re not going to stick to the
      business, and take Fabian&rsquo;s place in it? He&rsquo;s been for a week with Belloc
      and he&rsquo;s never coming back here. You have the brains for it; and you could
      make your father happy and inherit his fortune&mdash;all of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac flushed indignantly. &ldquo;I suppose I could, but it isn&rsquo;t big enough
      for me. I&rsquo;d rather do one picture that the Luxembourg or the London
      National Gallery would buy than own this whole business. That&rsquo;s the turn
      of my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but if you didn&rsquo;t sell a picture to the Luxembourg or the National
      Gallery. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a good try for it, that&rsquo;s all. Do you want me to give up Art and
      take to commerce? Is that your view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggested to John Grier the day that Fabian sold his share that you
      might take his place; and I still think it a good thing, though, of
      course, I like your painting. But I felt sorry for your father with none
      of his own family to help him; and I thought you might stay with him for
      your family&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I&rsquo;d be a martyr for love of John Grier&mdash;and cold cash,
      did you? That isn&rsquo;t the way the blood runs in my veins. I think John Grier
      might get out of the business now, if he&rsquo;s tired, and sell it and let some
      one else run it. John Grier is not in want. If he were, I&rsquo;d give up
      everything to help him, and I&rsquo;d not think I was a martyr. But I&rsquo;ve a right
      to make my own career. It&rsquo;s making the career one likes which gets one in
      the marrow. I&rsquo;d take my chances of success as he did. He has enough to
      live on, he&rsquo;s had success; let him get down and out, if he&rsquo;s tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl held herself firmly. &ldquo;Remember John Grier has made a great name
      for himself&mdash;as great in his way as Andrew Carnegie or Pierpont
      Morgan&mdash;and he&rsquo;s got pride in his name. He wants his son to carry it
      on, and in a way he&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good argument,&rdquo; said Carnac, &ldquo;but if his name isn&rsquo;t strong enough
      to carry itself, his son can&rsquo;t carry it for him. That&rsquo;s the way of life.
      How many sons have ever added to their father&rsquo;s fame? The instances are
      very few. In the modern world, I can only think of the Pitts in England.
      There&rsquo;s no one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl now smiled again. The best part in her was stirred. She saw. Her
      mind changed. After a moment she said: &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re altogether right
      about it. Carnac, you have your own career to make, so make it as it best
      suits yourself. I&rsquo;m sorry I spoke to your father as I did. I pitied him,
      and I thought you&rsquo;d find scope for your talents in the business. It&rsquo;s a
      big game, but I see now it isn&rsquo;t yours, Carnac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, smiling. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it; that&rsquo;s it, I hate the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands. As his hand enclosed her long slim fingers, he felt he
      wished never to let them go, they were so thrilling; but he did, for the
      thought of Luzanne came to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Junia, and don&rsquo;t forget that John Grier&rsquo;s firm is the foe of
      the Belloc business,&rdquo; he said satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and went down the hill quickly, and as she went Carnac
      thought he had never seen so graceful a figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an evil Fate sent Luzanne my way!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later there came an ugly incident on the river. There was a
      collision between a gang of John Grier&rsquo;s and Belloc&rsquo;s men and one of
      Grier&rsquo;s men was killed. At the inquest, it was found that the man met his
      death by his own fault, having first attacked a Belloc man and injured
      him. The Belloc man showed the injury to the jury, and he was acquitted.
      Carnac watched the case closely, and instructed his lawyer to contend that
      the general attack was first made by Belloc&rsquo;s men, which was true; but the
      jury decided that this did not affect the individual case, and that the
      John Grier man met his death by his own fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shocking verdict!&rdquo; he said aloud in the Court when it was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Coroner, &ldquo;it is the verdict of men who use their judgment
      after hearing the evidence, and your remark is offensive and criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is criminal, I apologize,&rdquo; said Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must apologize for its offensiveness, or you will be arrested, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This nettled Carnac. &ldquo;I will not apologize for its offensiveness,&rdquo; he said
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constable, arrest this man,&rdquo; said the Coroner, and the constable did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be released on bail?&rdquo; asked Carnac with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a magistrate. Yes, you may be released on bail,&rdquo; said the Coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac bowed, and at once a neighbour became security for three thousand
      dollars. Then Carnac bowed again and left the Court with&mdash;it was
      plain&mdash;the goodwill of most people present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac returned to his office with angry feelings at his heart. The Belloc
      man ought to have been arrested for manslaughter, he thought. In any case,
      he had upheld the honour of John Grier&rsquo;s firm by his protest, and the
      newspapers spoke not unfavourably of him in their reports. They said he
      was a man of courage to say what he did, though it was improper, from a
      legal standpoint. But human nature was human nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial took place in five days, and Carnac was fined twenty-five cents,
      which was in effect a verdict of not guilty; and so the newspapers said.
      It was decided that the offence was only legally improper, and it was
      natural that Carnac expressed himself strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia was present at the trial. After it was over, she saw Carnac for a
      moment. &ldquo;I think your firm can just pay the price and exist!&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible sum, and it shows how great a criminal you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a &lsquo;thirty-cent&rsquo; criminal, anyhow,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;It is a moral
      victory, and tell Fabian so. He&rsquo;s a bit huffy because I got into the
      trouble, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he loathed it all. He&rsquo;s sorry it occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no further talk between them, for a subordinate of Carnac&rsquo;s came
      hurriedly to him and said something which Junia did not hear. Carnac
      raised his hat to her, and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not so easy as painting pictures,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gets fussed
      over these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was later announced by the manager of the main mill that there was to
      be a meeting of workers to agitate for a strike for higher pay. A
      French-Canadian who had worked in the mills of Maine and who was a red-hot
      socialist was the cause of it. He had only been in the mills for about
      three months and had spent his spare time inciting well-satisfied workmen
      to strike. His name was Luc Baste&mdash;a shock-haired criminal with a
      huge chest and a big voice, and a born filibuster. The meeting was held
      and a deputation was appointed to wait on Carnac at his office. Word was
      sent to Carnac, and he said he would see them after the work was done for
      the day. So in the evening about seven o&rsquo;clock the deputation of six men
      came, headed by Luc Baste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; Carnac asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luc Baste began, not a statement of facts, but an oration on the rights of
      workers, their downtrodden condition and their beggarly wages. He said
      they had not enough to keep body and soul together, and that right well
      did their employers know it. He said there should be an increase of a
      half-dollar a day, or there would be a strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac dealt with the matter quickly and quietly. He said Luc Baste had
      not been among them a long time and evidently did not know what was the
      cost of living in Montreal. He said the men got good wages, and in any
      case it was not for him to settle a thing of such importance. This was for
      the head of the firm, John Grier, when he returned. The wages had been
      raised two years before, and he doubted that John Grier would consent to a
      further rise. All other men on the river seemed satisfied and he doubted
      these ought to have a cent more a day. They were getting the full value of
      the work. He begged all present to think twice before they brought about
      catastrophe. It would be a catastrophe if John Grier&rsquo;s mills should stop
      working and Belloc&rsquo;s mills should go on as before. It was not like Grier&rsquo;s
      men to do this sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men seemed impressed, and, presently, after one of them thanking him,
      the deputation withdrew, Luc Baste talking excitedly as they went. The
      manager of the main mill, with grave face, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Grier, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be satisfied. You said all that
      could be said, but I think they&rsquo;ll strike after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope it won&rsquo;t occur before John Grier gets back,&rdquo; said Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night a strike was declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, only about two-thirds of the men came out, and it could not
      be called a complete success. The Belloc people were delighted, but they
      lived in daily fear of a strike in their own yards, for agitators were
      busy amongst their workmen. But the workers waited to see what would
      happen to Grier&rsquo;s men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac declined to reconsider. The wages were sufficient and the strike
      unwarranted! He kept cool, even good-natured, and with only one-third of
      his men at work, he kept things going, and the business went on with
      regularity, if with smaller output. The Press unanimously supported him,
      for it was felt the strike had its origin in foreign influence, and as
      French Canada had no love for the United States there was journalistic
      opposition to the strike. Carnac had telegraphed to his father when the
      strike started, but did not urge him to come back. He knew that Grier
      could do nothing more than he himself was doing, and he dreaded new
      influence over the strikers. Grier happened to be in the backwoods and did
      not get word for nearly a week; then he wired asking Carnac what the
      present situation was. Carnac replied he was standing firm, that he would
      not yield a cent increase in wages, and that, so far, all was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, however, that on the day he wired, the strikers tried to
      prevent the non-strikers from going to work and there was a collision. The
      police and a local company of volunteers intervened and then the Press
      condemned unsparingly the whole affair. This outbreak did good, and Luc
      Baste was arrested for provoking disorder. No one else was arrested, and
      this was a good thing, for, on the whole, even the men that followed Luc
      did not trust him. His arrest cleared the air and the strike broke. The
      next day, all the strikers returned, but Carnac refused their wages for
      the time they were on strike, and he had triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that very day John Grier started back to Montreal. He arrived in about
      four days, and when he came, found everything in order. He went straight
      from his home to the mill and there found Carnac in control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had trouble, eh, Carnac?&rdquo; he asked with a grin, after a moment of
      greeting. Carnac shrugged his shoulders, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first strike I ever had in my mills, and I hope it will be the
      last. I don&rsquo;t believe in knuckling down to labour tyranny, and I&rsquo;m glad
      you kept your hand steady. There&rsquo;ll be no more strikes in my mills&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      see to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve only just begun, and they&rsquo;ll go on, father. It&rsquo;s the influence of
      Canucs who have gone to the factories of Maine. They get bitten there with
      the socialistic craze, and they come back and make trouble. This strike
      was started by Luc Baste, a French-Canadian, who had been in Maine. You
      can&rsquo;t stop these things by saying so. There was no strike among Belloc&rsquo;s
      men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but did you have no trouble with Belloc&rsquo;s men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac told him of the death of the Grier man after the collision, of his
      own arrest and fine of twenty-five cents and of the attitude of the public
      and the Press. The old man was jubilant. &ldquo;Say, you did the thing in style.
      It was the only way to do it. You landed &lsquo;em with the protest fair and
      easy. You&rsquo;re going to be a success in the business, I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac for a moment looked at his father meditatively. Then, seeing the
      surprise in John Grier&rsquo;s face, he said: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to be a success
      in it, for I&rsquo;m not going on with it. I&rsquo;ve had enough. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had enough&mdash;you&rsquo;re through&mdash;just when you&rsquo;ve proved you
      can do things as well as I can do them! You ain&rsquo;t going on! Great
      Jehoshaphat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it; I&rsquo;m not going on. I&rsquo;m going to quit in another month. I can&rsquo;t
      stick it. It galls me. It ain&rsquo;t my job. I do it, but it&rsquo;s artificial, it
      ain&rsquo;t the real thing. My heart isn&rsquo;t in it as yours is, and I&rsquo;d go mad if
      I had to do this all my life. It&rsquo;s full of excitement at times, it&rsquo;s hard
      work, it&rsquo;s stimulating when you&rsquo;re fighting, but other times it&rsquo;s deadly
      dull and bores me stiff. I feel as though I were pulling a train of cars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the old man&rsquo;s face reddened with anger. &ldquo;It bores you stiff, eh?
      It&rsquo;s deadly dull at times! There&rsquo;s only interest in it when there&rsquo;s a
      fight on, eh? You&rsquo;re right; you&rsquo;re not fit for the job, never was and
      never will be while your mind is what it is. Don&rsquo;t take a month to go,
      don&rsquo;t take a week, or a day, go this morning after I&rsquo;ve got your report on
      what&rsquo;s been done. It ain&rsquo;t the real thing, eh? No, it ain&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s no place
      for you. Tell me all there is to tell, and get out; I&rsquo;ve had enough too,
      I&rsquo;ve had my fill. &lsquo;It bores me stiff&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Grier was in a rage, and he would listen to no explanation. &ldquo;Come
      now, out with your report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was not upset. He kept cool. &ldquo;No need to be so crusty,&rdquo; he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. LUKE TARBOE HAS AN OFFER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many a man behind his horses&rsquo; tails on the countryside has watched the
      wild reckless life of the water with wonder and admiration. He sees a
      cluster of logs gather and climb, and still gather and climb, and between
      him and that cluster is a rolling waste of timber, round and square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a being with a red shirt, with loose prairie kind of hat,
      knee-boots, having metal clamps, strikes out from the shore, running on
      the tops of the moving logs till he reaches the jam. Then the pike-pole,
      or the lever, reaches the heart of the difficulty, and presently the jam
      breaks, and the logs go tumbling into the main, while the vicious-looking
      berserker of the water runs back to the shore over the logs, safe and
      sound. It is a marvel to the spectator, that men should manipulate the
      river so. To him it is a life apart; not belonging to the life he lives-a
      passing show.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a stark surprise of the river which makes this story possible.
      There was a strike at Bunder&rsquo;s Boom&mdash;as it was called&mdash;between
      Bunder and Grier&rsquo;s men. Some foreman of Grier&rsquo;s gang had been needlessly
      offensive. Bunder had been stupidly resentful. When Grier&rsquo;s men had tried
      to force his hand also, he had resisted. It chanced that, when an impasse
      seemed possible to be broken only by force, a telegram came to John Grier
      at Montreal telling him of the difficulty. He lost no time in making his
      way northwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some one else had come upon the scene. It was Luke Tarboe. He had
      arrived at a moment when the Belloc river crowd had almost wrecked
      Bunder&rsquo;s Boom, and when a collision between the two gangs seemed
      inevitable. What he did remained a river legend. By good temper and
      adroitness, he reconciled the leaders of the two gangs; he bought the
      freedom of the river by a present to Bunder&rsquo;s daughter; he won Bunder by
      four bottles of &ldquo;Three Star&rdquo; brandy. When the police from a town a hundred
      miles away arrived at the same time as John Grier, it was to find the
      Grier and Belloc gangs peacefully prodding side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the police had gone, John Grier looked Tarboe up and down. The brown
      face, the clear, strong brown eyes and the brown hatless head rose up
      eighteen inches above his own, making a gallant summit to a robust stalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve done easier things than that in your time, eh?&rdquo; John Grier
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe nodded. &ldquo;It was touch and go. I guess it was the hardest thing I
      ever tried since I&rsquo;ve been working for you, but it&rsquo;s come off all right,
      hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He waved a hand to the workmen on the river, to the tumbling
      rushes of logs and timber. Then he looked far up the stream, with hand
      shading his brown eyes to where a crib-or raft-was following the eager
      stream of logs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy going now,&rdquo; he added, and his face had a look
      of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your position, and what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; asked John Grier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m head-foreman of the Skunk Nest&rsquo;s gang&mdash;that&rsquo;s this lot, and I
      got here&mdash;just in time! I don&rsquo;t believe you could have done it, Mr.
      Grier. No master is popular in the real sense with his men. I think they&rsquo;d
      have turned you down. So it was lucky I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile hovered at his lips, and his eyes brooded upon the busy
      gangs of men. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of luck this time. There&rsquo;s nothing like
      keeping your head cool and your belly free from drink.&rdquo; Now he laughed
      broadly. &ldquo;By gosh, it&rsquo;s all good! Do you know, Mr. Grier, I came out here
      a wreck eight years ago. I left Montreal then with a spot in my lungs,
      that would kill me, they said. I&rsquo;ve never seen Montreal since, but I&rsquo;ve
      had a good time out in the woods, in the shanties in the winters; on the
      rivers in the summer. I&rsquo;ve only been as far East as this in eight years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do in the winter, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shanties-shanties all the time. In the summer this; in the Fall taking
      the men back to the shanties. Bossing the lot; doing it from love of the
      life that&rsquo;s been given back to me. Yes, this is the life that makes you
      take things easy. You don&rsquo;t get fussed out here. The job I had took a bit
      of doing, but it was done, and I&rsquo;m lucky to have my boss see the end of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled benignly upon John Grier. He knew he was valuable to the Grier
      organization; he knew that Grier had heard of him under another name. Now
      Grier had seen him, and he felt he would like to tell John Grier some
      things about the river he ought to know. He waved a hand declining the
      cigar offered him by his great chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I don&rsquo;t smoke, and I don&rsquo;t drink, and I don&rsquo;t chew; but I eat&mdash;by
      gosh, I eat! Nothing&rsquo;s so good as good food, except good reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good reading!&rdquo; exclaimed John Grier. &ldquo;Good reading&mdash;on the river!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s worked all right, and I read a lot. I get books from Montreal,
      from the old library at the University.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what University?&rdquo; struck in the lumber-king. &ldquo;Oh, Laval! I wouldn&rsquo;t go
      to McGill. I wanted to know French, so I went to Laval. There I came to
      know Father Labasse. He was a great man, Father Labasse. He helped me. I
      was there three years, and then was told I was going to die. It was
      Labasse who gave me this tip. He said, &lsquo;Go into the woods; put your teeth
      into the trees; eat the wild herbs, and don&rsquo;t come back till you feel
      well.&rsquo; Well, I haven&rsquo;t gone back, and I&rsquo;m not going back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do with your wages?&rdquo; asked the lumber-king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought land. I&rsquo;ve got a farm of four hundred acres twenty miles from
      here. I&rsquo;ve got a man on it working it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Do you suppose I&rsquo;d keep a farm that didn&rsquo;t pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who runs it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man that broke his leg on the river. One of Belloc&rsquo;s men. He knows all
      about farming. He brought his wife and three children up, and there he is&mdash;making
      money, and making the land good. I&rsquo;ve made him a partner at last. When
      it&rsquo;s good enough by and by, I&rsquo;ll probably go and live there myself.
      Anybody ought to make farming a success, if there&rsquo;s water and proper wood
      and such things,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments. Then John Grier looked Tarboe up and
      down sharply again, noting the splendid physique, the quizzical,
      mirth-provoking eye, and said: &ldquo;I can give you a better job if you&rsquo;ll come
      to Montreal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe shook his head. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had a sick day for eight years; I&rsquo;m as
      hard as nails; I&rsquo;m as strong as steel. I love this wild world of the woods
      and fields and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the shebangs and grog-shops and the dirty, drunken villages?&rdquo;
       interrupted the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t count. I take them in, but they don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you have hard times when you first came?&rdquo; asked John Grier. &ldquo;Did
      you get right with the men from the start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bit of care is a good thing in any life. I told them good
      stories, and they liked that. I used to make the stories up, and they
      liked that also. When I added some swear words they liked them all the
      better. I learned how to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of you, but not as Tarboe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard of me as Renton, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as Renton. I wonder I never came across you till to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kept out of your way; that was the reason. When you came north, I got
      farther into the backwoods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you absolutely straight, Tarboe?&rdquo; asked John Grier eagerly. &ldquo;Do you
      do these things in the Garden of Eden way, or can you run a bit crooked
      when it&rsquo;s worth while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d ever seen it worth while, I&rsquo;d say so. I could run a bit crooked if
      I was fighting among the big ones, or if we were at war with&mdash;Belloc,
      eh!&rdquo; A cloud came into the eyes of Tarboe. &ldquo;If I was fighting Belloc, and
      he used a weapon to flay me from behind, I&rsquo;d never turn my back on him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A grim smile came into Tarboe&rsquo;s face. His jaw set almost viciously, his
      eyes hardened. &ldquo;You people don&rsquo;t play your game very well, Mr. Grier. I&rsquo;ve
      seen a lot that wants changing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you change it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe laughed. &ldquo;If I was boss like you, I&rsquo;d change it, but I&rsquo;m not, and I
      stick to my own job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man came close to him, and steadily explored his face and eyes.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met anybody like you before. You&rsquo;re the man can do things and
      won&rsquo;t do them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I said what I meant&mdash;that good health is better
      than everything else in the world, and when you&rsquo;ve got it, you should keep
      it, if you can. I&rsquo;m going to keep mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, keep it in Montreal,&rdquo; said John Grier. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot doing there
      worth while. Is fighting worth anything to one that&rsquo;s got aught in him?
      There&rsquo;s war for the big things. I believe in war.&rdquo; He waved a hand.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between the kind of thing you&rsquo;ve done to-day, and
      doing it with the Belloc gang&mdash;with the Folson gang&mdash;with the
      Longville gang&mdash;and all the rest? It&rsquo;s the same thing. I was like you
      when I was young. I could do things you&rsquo;ve done to-day while I laid the
      base of what I&rsquo;ve got. How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirty&mdash;almost thirty-one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be just as well in Montreal to-morrow as you are here to-day, and
      you&rsquo;d be twice as clever,&rdquo; said John Grier. His eyes seemed to pierce
      those of the younger man. &ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; he continued, suddenly catching
      Tarboe&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, and you wouldn&rsquo;t run straight simply
      because it was the straight thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe threw back his head and laughed and nodded. The old man&rsquo;s eyes
      twinkled. &ldquo;By gracious, we&rsquo;re well met! I never was in a bigger hole in my
      life. One of my sons has left me. I bought him out, and he&rsquo;s joined my
      enemy Belloc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; remarked Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My other son, he&rsquo;s no good. He&rsquo;s as strong as a horse&mdash;but he&rsquo;s no
      good. He paints, he sculps. He doesn&rsquo;t care whether I give him money or
      not. He earns his living as he wants to earn it. When Fabian left me, I
      tried Carnac. I offered to take him in permanently. He tried it, but he
      wouldn&rsquo;t go on. He got out. He&rsquo;s twenty-six. The papers are beginning to
      talk about him. He doesn&rsquo;t care for that, except that it brings in cash
      for his statues and pictures. What&rsquo;s the good of painting and statuary, if
      you can&rsquo;t do the big things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think the things you do are as big as the things that Shakespeare,
      or Tennyson, or Titian, or Van Dyck, or Watt, or Rodin do&mdash;or did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigger-much bigger,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man smiled. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the way to look at it, I suppose.
      Think the thing you do is better than what anybody else does, and you&rsquo;re
      well started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and do it too. You&rsquo;re the only man I&rsquo;ve cottoned to in years. Come
      with me, and I&rsquo;ll give you twelve thousand dollars a year; and I&rsquo;ll take
      you into my business.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you the best chance you ever had.
      You&rsquo;ve found your health; come back and keep it. Don&rsquo;t you long for the
      fight, for your finger at somebody&rsquo;s neck? That&rsquo;s what I felt when I was
      your age, and I did it, and I&rsquo;m doing it, but I can&rsquo;t do it as I used to.
      My veins are leaking somewhere.&rdquo; A strange, sad, faded look came into his
      eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my business to be broken by Belloc,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Come
      and help me save it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gosh, I will!&rdquo; said the young man after a moment, with a sudden thirst
      in his throat and bite to his teeth. &ldquo;By gum, yes, I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &ldquo;AT OUR PRICE?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      West of the city of Montreal were the works and the offices of John Grier.
      Here it was that a thing was done without which there might have been no
      real story to tell. It was a night which marked the close of the financial
      year of the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon John Grier had come Carnac. He had brought with him a small statue of
      a riverman with flannel shirt, scarf about the waist, thick defiant
      trousers and well-weaponed boots. It was a real figure of the river,
      buoyant, daring, almost vicious. The head was bare; there were plain gold
      rings in the ears; and the stark, half-malevolent eyes looked out, as
      though searching for a jam of logs or some peril of the river. In the
      horny right hand was a defiant pike-pole, its handle thrust forward, its
      steel spike stabbing the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first glance, Carnac saw that John Grier was getting worn and old. The
      eyes were not so flashing as they once were; the lips were curled in a
      half-cynical mood. The old look of activity was fading; something vital
      had struck soul and body. He had had a great year. He had fought Belloc
      and his son Fabian successfully; he had laid new plans and strengthened
      his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe coming into the business had made all the difference to him. Tarboe
      had imagination, skill and decision, he seldom lost his temper; he kept a
      strong hand upon himself. His control of men was marvellous; his knowledge
      of finance was instinctive; his capacity for organization was rare, and he
      had health unbounded and serene. It was hard to tell what were the
      principles controlling Tarboe&mdash;there was always an element of
      suspicion in his brown and brilliant eyes. Yet he loved work. The wind of
      energy seemed to blow through his careless hair. His hands were like iron
      and steel; his lips were quick and friendly, or ruthless, as seemed
      needed. To John Grier&rsquo;s eyes he was the epitome of civilization&mdash;the
      warrior without a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carnac came in now with the statue tucked under his arm, smiling and
      self-contained, it seemed as though something had been done by Fate to
      flaunt John Grier.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a nod, Carnac put the statue on the table in front of the old man,
      and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve lifted that out of the
      river-life. That&rsquo;s one of the best men you ever had, and he&rsquo;s only one of
      a thousand. He doesn&rsquo;t belong anywhere. He&rsquo;s a rover, an adventurer, a
      wanton of the waters. Look at him. He&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; He asked
      this again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The timber-man waved the statue aside, and looked at the youth with
      critical eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been making up the accounts for the year,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been the best year I&rsquo;ve had in seven. I&rsquo;ve taken the starch
      out of Belloc and Fabian. I&rsquo;ve broken the back of their opposition&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      got it like a twig in iron teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Tarboe&rsquo;s been some use, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; was the suggestive response.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Grier&rsquo;s eyes hardened. &ldquo;You might have done it. You had it in you.
      The staff of life&mdash;courage and daring&mdash;were yours, and you
      wouldn&rsquo;t take it on. What&rsquo;s the result? I&rsquo;ve got a man who&rsquo;s worth two of
      Fabian and Belloc. And you&rdquo;&mdash;he held up a piece of paper&mdash;&ldquo;see
      that,&rdquo; he broke off. &ldquo;See that. It&rsquo;s my record. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m worth.
      That&rsquo;s what you might have handled!&rdquo; He took a cigar from his pocket, cut
      off the blunt end, and continued: &ldquo;You threw your chance aside.&rdquo; He tapped
      the paper with the point of the cigar. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Tarboe has helped do.
      What have you got to show?&rdquo; He pointed to the statue. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say it
      ain&rsquo;t good. It&rsquo;s a live man from the river. But what do I want with that,
      when I can have the original man himself! My boy, the great game of life
      is to fight hard, and never to give in. If you keep your eyes open,
      things&rsquo;ll happen that&rsquo;ll bring what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, striking a match to light his cigar. It was dusk, and the
      light of the match gave a curious, fantastic glimmer to his powerful,
      weird, haggard face. He was like some remnant of a great life, loose in a
      careless world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he said, the smoke leaking from his mouth like a drift of
      snow, &ldquo;the only thing worth doing is making the things that matter in the
      commerce and politics of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were a politician,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m a
      politician,&rdquo; was the inflammable reply. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s commerce without politics?
      It&rsquo;s politics that makes the commerce possible. There&rsquo;s that fellow
      Barouche&mdash;Barode Barouche&mdash;he&rsquo;s got no money, but he&rsquo;s a
      Minister, and he can make you rich or poor by planning legislation at
      Ottawa that&rsquo;ll benefit or hamper you. That&rsquo;s the kind of business that&rsquo;s
      worth doing&mdash;seeing into the future, fashioning laws that make good
      men happy and bad men afraid. Don&rsquo;t I know! I&rsquo;m a master-man in my
      business; nothing defeats me. To me, a forest of wild wood is the future
      palace of a Prime Minister. A great river is a pathway to the palace, and
      all the thousands of men that work the river are the adventurers that
      bring the booty home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bring &lsquo;the palace to Paris,&rsquo; eh!&rdquo; interrupted Carnac, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris be damned&mdash;that bring the forest to Quebec. How long did it
      take you to make that?&rdquo; he added with a nod towards the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I did it in a day&mdash;six hours, I think; and he stood like that
      for three hours out of the six. He was great, but he&rsquo;d no more sense of
      civilization than I have of Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to have a sense of Heaven, you need to have a sense of
      Hell. That prevents you from spoiling your own show. You&rsquo;re playing with
      life&rsquo;s vital things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how much you&rsquo;ve got out of it all, father,&rdquo; Carnac remarked with
      a smile. He lit a cigarette. &ldquo;You do your job in style. It&rsquo;s been a great
      career, yours. You&rsquo;ve made your big business out of nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had something to start with. Your grandfather had a business worth not
      much, but it was a business, and the fundamental thing is to have
      machinery to work with when you start life. I had that. My father was
      narrow, contracted and a blunderer, but he made good in a small way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you in a big way,&rdquo; said Carnac, with admiration and criticism in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that John Grier had summed him up fairly when he said he was
      playing with life&rsquo;s vital things. Somehow, he saw the other had a grip
      upon essentials lacking in himself; he had his tooth in the orange, as it
      were, and was sucking the juice of good profit from his labours. Yet he
      knew how much trickery and vital evasion and harsh aggression there were
      in his father&rsquo;s business life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet he had never seen Tarboe&mdash;he had been away in the country the
      whole year nearly&mdash;but he imagined a man of strength, abilities,
      penetration and deep power. He knew that only a man with savage instincts
      could work successfully with John Grier; he knew that Grier was without
      mercy in his business, and that his best year&rsquo;s work had been marked by a
      mandatory power which only a malevolent policy could produce. Yet,
      somehow, he had a feeling that Tarboe had a steadying influence on John
      Grier. The old man was not so uncontrolled as in bygone days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Tarboe,&rdquo; Carnac said suddenly. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t the same as
      you,&rdquo; snapped John Grier. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bigger, broader, and buskier.&rdquo; A malicious
      smile crossed over his face. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bandit&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he is. He&rsquo;s
      got a chest like a horse and lungs like the ocean. When he&rsquo;s got a thing,
      he&rsquo;s got it like a nail in a branch of young elm. He&rsquo;s a dandy, that
      fellow.&rdquo; Suddenly passion came to his eyes. &ldquo;You might have done it,
      you&rsquo;ve got the brains, and the sense, but you ain&rsquo;t got the ambition. You
      keep feeling for a thousand things instead of keeping your grip on one.
      The man that succeeds fastens hard on what he wants to do&mdash;the one
      big thing, and he does it, thinking of naught else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good preaching,&rdquo; remarked Carnac coolly. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t
      mean that a man should stick to one thing, if he finds out he&rsquo;s been wrong
      about it? We all make mistakes. Perhaps some day I&rsquo;ll wish I&rsquo;d gone with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimness came into the old man&rsquo;s face. Something came into his eyes that
      was strange and revealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you will. But you had your chance with me, and you threw it
      down like a piece of rotten leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t cost you anything,&rdquo; returned Carnac. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid my own way a long
      time&mdash;with mother&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re twenty-six years old, and what have you got? Enough to give
      you bread from day to day-no more. I was worth seventy thousand dollars
      when I was your age. I&rsquo;m worth enough to make a prince rich, and if I&rsquo;d
      been treated right by those I brought into the world I&rsquo;d be worth twice as
      much. Fabian was good as far as he went, but he was a coward. You&rdquo;&mdash;a
      look of fury entered the dark eyes&mdash;&ldquo;you were no coward, but you
      didn&rsquo;t care a damn. You wanted to paddle about with muck of imagination&mdash;&rdquo;
       he pointed to the statue on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your business has been great because of your imagination,&rdquo; was the
      retort. &ldquo;You saw things ahead with the artist&rsquo;s eye. You planned with the
      artist&rsquo;s mind; and brought forth what&rsquo;s to your honour and credit&mdash;and
      the piling up of your bank balance. The only thing that could have induced
      me to work in your business is the looking ahead and planning, seeing the
      one thing to be played off against the other, the fighting of strong men,
      the politics, all the forces which go to make or break your business.
      Well, I didn&rsquo;t do it, and I&rsquo;m not sorry. I have a gift which, by training
      and development, will give me a place among the men who do things, if I
      have good luck&mdash;good luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dwelt upon these last words with an intensity which dreaded something.
      There was retrospection in his eyes. A cloud seemed to cross his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong step crunching the path stopped the conversation, and presently
      there appeared the figure of Tarboe. Certainly the new life had not
      changed Tarboe, had not altered his sturdy, strenuous nature. His brown
      eyes under the rough thatch of his eyebrow took in the room with lightning
      glance, and he nodded respectfully, yet with great friendliness, at John
      Grier. He seemed to have news, and he glanced with doubt at Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Grier understood. &ldquo;Go ahead. What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that can&rsquo;t wait till I&rsquo;m introduced to your son,&rdquo; rejoined
      Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a friendly look, free from all furtiveness, Carnac reached out a
      hand, small, graceful, firm. As Tarboe grasped it in his own big paw, he
      was conscious of a strength in the grip which told him that the physical
      capacity of the &ldquo;painter-fellow,&rdquo; as he afterwards called Carnac, had
      points worthy of respect. On the instant, there was admiration on the part
      of each&mdash;admiration and dislike. Carnac liked the new-comer for his
      healthy bearing, for the iron hardness of his head, and for the
      intelligence of his dark eyes. He disliked him, however, for something
      that made him critical of his father, something covert and devilishly
      alert. Both John Grier and Tarboe were like two old backwoodsmen, eager to
      reach their goal, and somewhat indifferent to the paths by which they
      travelled to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe, on the other hand, admired the frank, pleasant face of the young
      man, which carried still the irresponsibility of youth, but which conveyed
      to the watchful eye a brave independence, a fervid, and perhaps futile,
      challenge to all the world. Tarboe understood that this young man had a
      frankness dangerous to the business of life, yet which, properly applied,
      might bring great results. He disliked Carnac for his uncalculating
      candour; but he realized that, behind all, was something disturbing to his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman,&rdquo; Tarboe said to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a woman. He&rsquo;s made a fool of
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe was right. He had done what no one else had done&mdash;he had
      pierced the cloud surrounding Carnac: it was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re pulling things off here,&rdquo; remarked Carnac civilly. &ldquo;He
      says&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to John Grier&mdash;&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re making the enemy
      squirm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe nodded, and a half-stealthy smile crept across his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think we&rsquo;ve lost anything coming our way,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had good
      luck&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our eyes were open,&rdquo; intervened John Grier. &ldquo;You push the brush and
      use the chisel, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Tarboe in spite of himself with slight
      scorn in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I push the chisel and use the brush,&rdquo; answered Carnac, smilingly
      correcting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing. Is it yours?&rdquo; asked Tarboe, nodding and pointing to
      the statue of the riverman. Carnac nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I did that one day. I&rsquo;d
      like to do you, if you&rsquo;d let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young giant waved a brawny hand and laughed. He looked down at his
      knee-boots, with their muddied soles, and then at the statue again on the
      table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind you&rsquo;re doing me. Turn about is fair play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done you out of your job.&rdquo; Then he added to the old man: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good
      news I&rsquo;ve got. I&rsquo;ve made the contract with the French firm at our price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At our price!&rdquo; remarked the other with a grim smile. &ldquo;For the lot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for the lot, and I&rsquo;ve made the contracts with the ships to carry
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At our price?&rdquo; again asked the old man. Tarboe nodded. &ldquo;Just a little
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed those two things could have been done in the
      time.&rdquo; Grier rubbed his hands cheerfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good day&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s
      the best you&rsquo;ve done since you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac watched the scene with interest. No envy moved him, his soul was
      free from malice. Evidently Tarboe was a man of power. Ruthless he might
      be, ruthless and unsparing, but a man of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a clerk entered with a letter in his hand. &ldquo;Mrs. Grier
      said to give you this,&rdquo; he remarked to Carnac, handing it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac took it and the clerk departed. The letter had an American
      postmark, and the handwriting on the letter brought trouble to his eyes.
      He composed himself, however, and tore off the end of the envelope, taking
      out the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was brief. It contained only a few lines, but as Carnac read them the
      colour left his face. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said to himself. Then he put the
      paper in his pocket, and, with a forced smile and nod to his father and
      Tarboe, left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer. The letter seemed to get him in the vitals,&rdquo; said John
      Grier with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe nodded, and said to himself: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman all right.&rdquo; He smiled to
      himself also. He had wondered why Carnac and Junia Shale had not come to
      an understanding. The letter which had turned Carnac pale was the
      interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, sit down, Tarboe,&rdquo; said John Grier. &ldquo;I want to talk with you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. JOHN GRIER MAKES ANOTHER OFFER
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping my eye on you, Tarboe,&rdquo; John Grier said presently, his
      right hand clutching unconsciously the statue which his boy had left with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d forget me when I was making or breaking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a winner, Tarboe. You&rsquo;ve got sense and judgment, and you ain&rsquo;t
      afraid to get your own way by any route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and gripped the statue closely in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe nodded. In the backwoods he had been without ambition save to be
      master of what he was doing and of the men who were part of his world of
      responsibility. Then John Grier had pulled him back into industry and he
      had since desired to ascend, to &ldquo;make good.&rdquo; Also, he had seen Junia
      often, and for her an aspiration had sprung up in him like a fire in a
      wild place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he first saw her, she was standing in the doorway through which
      Carnac had just passed. The brightness of her face, the wonder of her
      eyes, the glow of her cheek, had made his pulses throb as they had never
      throbbed before. He had put the thought of her away from him, but it had
      come back constantly until he had found himself looking for her in the
      street, and on the hill that led to John Grier&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe realized that the girl was drawn towards Carnac, and that Carnac
      was drawn towards the girl, but that some dark depths lay between. The
      letter Carnac had just received seemed to him the plumbline of that abyss.
      Carnac and the girl were suited to each other&mdash;that was clear; and
      the girl was enticing, provoking and bewildering&mdash;that was the
      modelling fact. He had satisfaction that he had displaced Carnac in this
      great business, and there was growing in him a desire to take away the
      chances of the girl from Carnac also. With his nature it was inevitable.
      Life to him was now a puzzle towards the solution of which he moved with
      conquering conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      From John Grier&rsquo;s face now, he realized that something was to be said
      affecting his whole career. It would, he was sure, alter his foot-steps in
      the future. He had a profound respect for the little wiry man, with the
      firm body and shrivelled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe watched the revealing expression of the old man&rsquo;s face and the
      motions of his body. He noticed that the tight grip of the hand on the
      little statue of the riverman had made the fingers pale. He realized how
      absorbed was the lumber-king, who had given him more confidence than he
      had given to anyone else in the world. As near as he could come to anyone,
      he had come to John Grier. There had been differences between them, but
      he, Tarboe, fought for his own idea, and, in nine cases out of ten, had
      conquered. John Grier had even treated Tarboe&rsquo;s solutions as though they
      were his own. He had a weird faith in the young giant. He saw now Tarboe&rsquo;s
      eyes fixed on his fingers, and he released his grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing between him and me, Tarboe,&rdquo; he said, nodding towards
      the virile bronze. &ldquo;Think of my son doing that when he could do all this!&rdquo;
       He swept his arm in a great circle which included the horizon beyond the
      doors and the windows. &ldquo;It beats me, and because it beats me, and because
      he defies me, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything you&rsquo;d be sorry for, boss. He ain&rsquo;t a fool because he&rsquo;s
      not what you are.&rdquo; He nodded towards the statue. &ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s
      pottering. I think it&rsquo;s good stuff. It will last, perhaps, when what you
      and I do is forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something big and moving in Tarboe. He was a contradiction. A
      lover of life, he was also reckless in how he got what he wanted. If it
      could not be got by the straight means, then it must be by the crooked,
      and that was where he and Grier lay down together, as it were. Yet he had
      some knowledge that was denied to John Grier. The soul of the greater
      things was in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the boy a chance to work out his life in his own way,&rdquo; he said
      manfully. &ldquo;You gave him a chance to do it in your way, and you were turned
      down. Have faith in him. He&rsquo;ll probably come out all right in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he&rsquo;ll come my way?&rdquo; asked the old man almost rabidly. &ldquo;You mean
      he&rsquo;ll do the things I want him to do here, as you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; answered Tarboe, but without conviction in his tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not sure whether it will be like that or not, but I know you&rsquo;ve got a son
      as honest as the stars, and the honest man gets his own in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for some time, then the old man began walking up and
      down the room, softly, noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I care for that boy, but I care for my life&rsquo;s
      work more. Day in, day out, night in, night out, I&rsquo;ve slaved for it,
      prayed for it, believed in it, and tried to make my wife and my boys feel
      as I do about it, and none of them cares as I care. Look at Fabian&mdash;over
      with the enemy, fighting his own father; look at Carnac, out in the open,
      taking his own way.&rdquo; He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your wife?&rdquo; asked Tarboe almost furtively, because it seemed to him
      that the old man was most unhappy in that particular field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been a good wife, but she don&rsquo;t care as I do for success and
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you never taught her,&rdquo; remarked Tarboe with silky irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taught her! What was there to teach? She saw me working; she knew the
      life I had to live; she was lifted up with me. I was giving her everything
      in me to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean money and a big house and servants and comfort,&rdquo; said Tarboe
      sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; snapped the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right, but it don&rsquo;t always bring you what you want. It&rsquo;s
      right, but it&rsquo;s wrong too. Women want more than that, boss. Women want to
      be loved&mdash;sky high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once Grier felt himself as far removed from Tarboe as he had ever
      been from Carnac, or his wife. Why was it? Suddenly Tarboe understood that
      between him and John Grier there must always be a flood. He realized that
      there was in Grier some touch of the insane thing; something apart, remote
      and terrible. He was convinced of it, when he saw Grier suddenly spring
      up, and pace the room again like a tortured animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got great influence with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was just going to tell
      you something that&rsquo;d give you pleasure, but what you&rsquo;ve said about my boy
      coming back has made me change what I was going to do. I don&rsquo;t need to say
      I like you. We were born in the same nest almost. We&rsquo;ve got the same
      ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; intervened Tarboe. &ldquo;Not quite, but almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is what I&rsquo;ve got to say. You&rsquo;ve got youth, courage, and good
      sense, and business ability, and what more does a man want in life, I ask
      you that?&rdquo; Tarboe nodded, but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t feel as strong as I used to do. I&rsquo;ve been breaking up this
      last year, just when we&rsquo;ve been knitting the cracks in the building. What
      was in my mind is this&mdash;to leave you when I die the whole of my
      business to keep it a success, and get in the way of Belloc, and pay my
      wife so much a year to live on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to your wife or your sons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Carnac, if I left him the business it&rsquo;d be dead in two years.
      Nothing could save it. He&rsquo;d spoil it, because he don&rsquo;t care for it. I
      bought Fabian out. As for my wife, she couldn&rsquo;t run it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could sell it,&rdquo; interrupted Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell it! Sell it!&rdquo; said Grier wildly. &ldquo;Sell it to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Belloc,&rdquo; was the malicious reply. The demon of anger seized the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that to me&mdash;you&mdash;that I should sell to Belloc! By hell,
      I&rsquo;d rather burn every stick and board and tree I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;sweep it out
      of existence, and die a beggar than sell it to Belloc!&rdquo; Froth gathered at
      the corners of his mouth, there was tumult in his eyes. &ldquo;Belloc! Knuckle
      down to him! Sell out to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you got a profit of twenty per cent. above what it&rsquo;s worth it
      might be well. That&rsquo;d be a triumph, not a defeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; said John Grier, the passion slowly going from his
      eyes. &ldquo;I see what you mean, but that ain&rsquo;t my way. I want this business to
      live. I want Grier&rsquo;s business to live long after John Grier has gone.
      That&rsquo;s why I was going to say to you that in my will I&rsquo;m going to leave
      you this business, you to pay my wife every year twenty thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your son, Carnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sou-not a sou&mdash;not a sou&mdash;nothing&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I
      meant at first. But I&rsquo;ve changed my mind now. I&rsquo;m going to leave you the
      business, if you&rsquo;ll make a bargain with me. I want you to run it for three
      years, and take for yourself all the profits over the twenty thousand
      dollars a year that goes to my wife. There&rsquo;s a lot of money in it, the way
      you&rsquo;d work it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand about the three years,&rdquo; said Tarboe, with rising
      colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because I haven&rsquo;t told you, but you&rsquo;ll take it in now. I&rsquo;m going to
      leave you the business as though you were going to have it for ever, but
      I&rsquo;ll make another will dated a week later, in which I leave it to Carnac.
      Something you said makes me think he might come right, and it will be
      playing fair to him to let him run himself alone, maybe with help from his
      mother, for three years. That&rsquo;s long enough, and perhaps the thought of
      what he might have had will work its way with him. If it don&rsquo;t&mdash;well,
      it won&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s all; but I want you to have the business long enough to
      baulk Belloc and Fabian the deserter. I want you for three years to fight
      this fight after I&rsquo;m gone. In that second secret will, I&rsquo;ll leave you two
      hundred thousand dollars. Are you game for it? Is it worthwhile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paused, his head bent forward, his eyes alert and searching,
      both hands gripping the table. There was a long silence, in which the
      ticking of the clock upon the wall seemed unduly loud and in which the
      buzz of cross-cut saws came sounding through the evening air. Yet Tarboe
      did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say?&rdquo; asked Grier at last. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you do it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying the thing out,&rdquo; answered Tarboe quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see
      about these two wills. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the second will be found first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you and I will be the only ones that&rsquo;ll know of it. That shows
      how much I trust you, Tarboe. I&rsquo;ll put it away where nobody can get it
      except you or me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if anything should happen to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d leave a letter with my bank, not to be opened for three years,
      or unless you died, and it would say that the will existed, where it was,
      and what its terms were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds all right,&rdquo; but there was a cloud on Tarboe&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great business,&rdquo; said Grier, seeing Tarboe&rsquo;s doubt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      biggest thing a man can do&mdash;and I&rsquo;m breaking up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man had said the right thing&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great business!&rdquo; It was
      the greatness of the thing that had absorbed Tarboe. It was the bigness
      made him feel life could be worth living, if the huge machinery were
      always in his fingers. Yet he had never expected it, and life was a
      problem. Who could tell? Perhaps&mdash;perhaps, the business would always
      be his in spite of the second will! Perhaps, he would have his chance to
      make good. He got to his feet; he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it worth any thanks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not between us,&rdquo; declared Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night&mdash;now.&rdquo; He drew out some paper and sat down with a pen in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; John Grier repeated.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE PUZZLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his way home, with Luzanne&rsquo;s disturbing letter in his pocket, Carnac
      met Junia. She was supremely Anglo-Saxon; fresh, fervid and buoyant with
      an actual buoyancy of the early spring. She had tact and ability,
      otherwise she could never have preserved peace between the contending
      factions, Belloc and Fabian, old John Grier, the mother and Carnac. She
      was as though she sought for nothing, wished nothing but the life in which
      she lived. Yet her wonderful pliability, her joyful boyishness, had behind
      all a delicate anxiety which only showed in flashes now and then, fully
      understood by no one except Carnac&rsquo;s mother and old Denzil. These two
      having suffered strangely in life had realized that the girl was always
      waiting for a curtain to rise which did not rise, for a voice to speak
      which gave no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet since Carnac&rsquo;s coming back there had appeared a slight change in her,
      a bountiful, eager alertness, a sense of wonder and experiment, adding new
      interest to her personality. Carnac was conscious of this increased
      vitality, was impressed and even provoked by it. Somehow he felt&mdash;for
      he had the telepathic mind&mdash;that the girl admired and liked Tarboe.
      He did not stop to question how or why she should like two people so
      different as Tarboe and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint colour of the crimsoning maples was now in her cheek; the light
      of the autumn evening was in her eyes; the soft vitality of September was
      in her motions. She was attractively alive. Her hair waved back from her
      forehead with natural grace; her small feet, with perfect ankles, made her
      foothold secure and sedately joyous. Her brown hand&mdash;yet not so brown
      after all&mdash;held her hat lightly, and was, somehow, like a signal out
      of a world in which his hopes were lost for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dearer to him than all the rest of the world; and he had in his
      hand what kept them apart&mdash;a sentence of death, unless he escaped
      from the wanton calling him to fulfil duties into which he had been
      tricked. Luzanne Larue had a terrible hold over him. He gripped the letter
      in his pocket as a Hopi Indian does the body of a poisonous snake. The
      rosy sunset gave the girl&rsquo;s face a reflected spiritual glamour; it made
      her, suddenly, a bewildering figure. Somehow, she seemed a great distance
      from him&mdash;as one detached and unfamiliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly felt she knew more than it was possible she should know. As
      she flashed an inquiry into his eyes, it was as though she said: &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you tell me everything, and I will help you?&rdquo; Or, was it: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
      you tell me everything and end it all?&rdquo; He longed to press her to his
      breast, as he had once done in the woods when Denzil had been injured, but
      that was not possible. The thought of that far-off day made him say to
      her, rather futilely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Denzil? How is Denzil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was swift surprise in her face. She seemed dumbfounded, and then she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denzil! He&rsquo;s all right, but he does not like your Mr. Tarboe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Mr. Tarboe! Where do I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got what you ought to have had,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;What you
      would have had, weren&rsquo;t you a foolish fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand how he is my Mr. Tarboe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been in your father&rsquo;s life if it weren&rsquo;t for you;
      if you had done what your father wished you to do, had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had sold myself for gold&mdash;my freedom, my health, everything to help
      my father&rsquo;s business! I don&rsquo;t see why he should expect that what he&rsquo;s
      doing some one else should do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Belloc would do, that Belloc and Fabian would do,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;what they two would do. There&rsquo;s no genius in it,
      though my father comes as near being a genius as any man alive. But
      there&rsquo;s a screw loose somewhere.... It wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me. It
      didn&rsquo;t give me a chance&mdash;in things that are of the mind, the spirit&mdash;my
      particular gifts, whatever they are. They would have chafed against that
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, you&rsquo;re a genius, which your father isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the girl said
      almost sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disturbed look came into Carnac&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have liked my father to be
      a genius. Then we&rsquo;d have hit it off together. I don&rsquo;t ever feel the things
      he does are the things I want to do; or the things he says are those I&rsquo;d
      like to say. He&rsquo;s a strange man. He lives alone. He never was really near
      Fabian or me. We were his sons, but though Fabian is a little bit like him
      in appearance, I&rsquo;m not, and never was. I always feel that&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused, and she took up the tale:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he wasn&rsquo;t the father you&rsquo;d have made for yourself, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s it. Conceit, ain&rsquo;t it? Perhaps the facts are, I&rsquo;m one of
      the most useless people that ever wore a coat. Perhaps the things I do
      aren&rsquo;t going to live beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as though your father&rsquo;s business is going to live after him,
      doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the girl asked mockingly. &ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo; she
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to take you home,&rdquo; he said, as he turned and walked by
      her side down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denzil will be glad to see you. He almost thinks I&rsquo;m a curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac smiled. &ldquo;All genius is at once a blessing or a curse. And what does
      Denzil think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;a blessing and a curse!&rdquo; she said whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t honestly think I&rsquo;m a blessing to anybody in this world. There&rsquo;s
      no one belonging to me who believes in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Denzil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He believes in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t belong to me; he isn&rsquo;t my family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are your family? Is it only those who are bone of your bone and flesh
      of your flesh? Your family is much wider, because you&rsquo;re a genius. It&rsquo;s
      worldwide&mdash;of all kinds. Denzil belongs to you, because you helped to
      save him years ago; the Catholic Archbishop belongs to you, because he&rsquo;s
      got brains and a love of literature and art; Barode Barouche belongs to
      you, because he&rsquo;s almost a genius too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barouche is a politician,&rdquo; said Carnac with slight derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t be a genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t Frenchmen genius?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughed. &ldquo;Why, of course. Barode Barouche&mdash;yes, he&rsquo;s a great
      one: he can think, he can write, and he can talk; and the talking&rsquo;s the
      best that he does&mdash;though I&rsquo;ve not heard him speak, but I&rsquo;ve read his
      speeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he make good laws at Ottawa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes laws at Ottawa&mdash;whether they&rsquo;re good or not is another
      question. I shouldn&rsquo;t be a follower of his, if I had my chance though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;m as French as can be! I felt at home with the French when I
      was in France. I was all Gallic. When I&rsquo;m here I&rsquo;m more Gallic than Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it. Here am I, with all my blood for generations
      Saxon, and yet I feel French. If I&rsquo;d been born in the old country, it
      would have been in Limerick or Tralee. I&rsquo;d have been Celtic there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet Barode Barouche is a great man. He gets drunk sometimes, but he&rsquo;s
      great. He gets hold of men like Denzil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denzil has queer tastes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he worships you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not queer, it&rsquo;s abnormal,&rdquo; said Carnac with gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m abnormal,&rdquo; she said with a mocking laugh, and swung her hat on
      her fingers like a wheel. Something stormy and strange swam in Carnac&rsquo;s
      eyes. All his trouble rushed back on him; the hand in his pocket crushed
      the venomous letter he had received, but he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t worship me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it said all true intelligence is the slave of genius?&rdquo; she
      questioned, a little paler than usual, her eye on the last gleam of the
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who said it, but if that&rsquo;s why you worship me, I know how
      hollow it all is,&rdquo; he declared sullenly, for she was pouring carbolic acid
      into a sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to drag the letter from his pocket and hand it her to read; to
      tell her the whole distressful story: but he dared not. He longed for her,
      and yet he dared not tell her so. He half drew the letter from his pocket,
      but thrust it back again. Tell this innocent girl the whole ugly story? It
      could not be done. There was but one thing to do&mdash;to go away, to put
      this world of French Canada behind him, and leave her free to follow her
      fancy, or some one else&rsquo;s fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or some one else&rsquo;s fancy? There was Tarboe. Tarboe had taken from him the
      place in the business which should be his; he had displaced him in his
      father&rsquo;s affections... and now Junia!
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out a hand to the girl. &ldquo;I must go and see my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes abashed her. She realized there was trouble in the face of the
      man who all her life had been strangely near and dear to her. With
      impulsiveness, she said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in trouble, Carnac. Let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For one swift instant he almost yielded. Then he gripped her hand and
      said: &ldquo;No-no-no. It can&rsquo;t be done&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let Denzil help you. Here he is,&rdquo; she remarked, and she glanced
      affectionately at the greyish, tousled head of the habitant who was
      working in the garden of her father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was master of himself again. &ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Denzil!
      Denzil!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man looked up. An instant later the figure of the girl
      fluttered through the doorway of her home, and Carnac stopped beside
      Denzil in the garden.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. DENZIL TELLS HIS STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep going, Denzil,&rdquo; remarked Carnac as he lighted his pipe and came
      close to the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the toiler lighted, the eyes gazed kindly, at Carnac. &ldquo;What
      else is there to do? We must go on. There&rsquo;s no standing still in the
      world. We must go on&mdash;surelee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when it&rsquo;s hard going, eh?&rdquo; asked Carnac, not to get an answer so
      much as to express his own feelings. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s
      how it is. We can&rsquo;t stand still even when it&rsquo;s hard going&mdash;but, no,
      bagosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He realized that around Carnac there was a shadow which took its toll of
      light and life. He had the sound instinct of primitive man. Strangely
      enough in his own eyes was the look in those of Carnac, a past, hovering
      on the brink of revelation. His appearance was that of one who had
      suffered; his knotted hands, dark with warm blood, had in them a story of
      life&rsquo;s sorrows; his broad shoulders were stooped with the inertia of long
      regret; his feet clung to the ground as though there was a great weight
      above them. But a smile shimmered at his mouth, giving to his careworn
      face something almost beautiful, lifting the darkness from his powerful,
      shaggy forehead. Many men knew Denzil by sight, few knew him in actual
      being. There was a legend that once he was about to be married, but the
      girl had suddenly gone mad and drowned herself in the river. No one
      thought it strange that a month later the eldest son of the Tarboe family
      had been found dead in the woods with a gun in his hand and a bullet
      through his heart. No one had ever linked the death of Denzil&rsquo;s loved one
      with that of Almeric Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unusual for a Frenchman to give up his life to an English family,
      but that is what he had done, and of late he had watched Junia with new
      eager solicitude. The day she first saw Tarboe had marked an exciting
      phase in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil had studied her, and he knew vaguely that a fresh interest,
      disturbing, electrifying, had entered into her. Because it was Tarboe, the
      fifteen years younger brother of that Almeric Tarboe who had died a month
      after his own girl had left this world, his soul was fighting&mdash;fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the smoke of Carnac&rsquo;s pipe came curling into the air, Denzil put on his
      coat, and laid the hoe and rake on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, even when it&rsquo;s hard going we still have to march on&mdash;name of
      God, yes!&rdquo; he repeated, and he looked at Carnac quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going? Don&rsquo;t you want to talk to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. If you&rsquo;ll come with me I&rsquo;ll give you a drink of
      hard cider, the best was ever made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come. Denzil, I&rsquo;ve never been in your little house. That&rsquo;s strange,
      when I&rsquo;ve known you so many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late to mend, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. There ain&rsquo;t much in it, but it&rsquo;s all
      I need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac stepped with Denzil towards the little house, just in front of
      three pine-trees on the hill, and behind Junia&rsquo;s home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always lock my door&mdash;always,&rdquo; said Denzil as he turned a key and
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered into the cool shade of a living-room. There was little
      furniture, yet against the wall was a kind of bunk, comfortable and roomy,
      on which was stretched the skin of a brown bear. On the wall above it was
      a crucifix, and on the opposite wall was the photograph of a girl,
      good-looking, refined, with large, imaginative eyes, and a face that might
      have been a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac gazed at it for a moment, absorbed. &ldquo;That was your girl, Denzil,
      wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil nodded. &ldquo;The best the world ever had, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the
      very best, but she went queer and drowned herself&mdash;ah, but yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She just went queer, eh!&rdquo; Carnac said, looking Denzil straight in the
      eyes. &ldquo;Was there insane blood in her family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t insane,&rdquo; answered Denzil firmly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d been bad used&mdash;terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t come out at the inquest, did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely. She wrote it me. I&rsquo;m telling you what I&rsquo;ve never told
      anyone.&rdquo; He shut the door, as though to make a confessional. &ldquo;She wrote it
      me, and I wasn&rsquo;t telling anyone-but no. She&rsquo;d been away down at Quebec
      City, and there a man got hold of her. Almeric Tarboe it was&mdash;the
      older brother of Luke Tarboe at John Grier&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Suddenly the face of the
      little man went mad with emotion. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac held up his hand. &ldquo;No-no-no, don&rsquo;t tell me. Tarboe&mdash;I
      understand, the Unwritten Law. You haven&rsquo;t told me, but I understand. I
      remember: he was found in the woods with his gun in his hand-dead. I read
      it all by accident long ago; and that was the story, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She was young, full of imagination. She loved me, but he was clever,
      and he was high up, and she was low down. He talked her blind, and then in
      the woods it was, in the woods where he died, that he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the little man wrung his fingers like one robbed of reason. &ldquo;He
      was a strongman,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and she was a girl, weak, but not wanton
      ... and so she died, telling me, loving me&mdash;so she died, and so he
      died, too, in the woods with his gun in his hand. Yes, &lsquo;twas done with his
      own gun&mdash;by accident&mdash;by accident! He stumbled, and the gun went
      off. That was the story at the inquest. No one knew I was there. I was
      never seen with him and I&rsquo;ve never been sorry. He got what he deserved&mdash;sacre,
      yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something overwhelming in the face of the little resolute,
      powerful man. His eyes were aflame. He was telling for the first time the
      story of his lifelong agony and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to be done. She was young, so sweet, so good, aye, she was good-in
      her soul she was good, ah, surelee. That&rsquo;s why she died in the pond. No
      one knew. The inquest did not bring out anything, but that&rsquo;s why he died;
      and ever since I&rsquo;ve been mourning; life has no rest for me. I&rsquo;m not sorry
      for what I did. I&rsquo;ve told it you because you saved me years ago when I
      fell down the bank. You were only fourteen then, but I&rsquo;ve never forgotten.
      And she, that sweet young lady, she&mdash;she was there too; and now when
      I look at this Tarboe, the brother of that man, and see her and know what
      I know&mdash;sacre!&rdquo; He waved a hand. &ldquo;No-no-no, don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s
      anything except what&rsquo;s in the soul. That man has touched ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know why, but he has touched her heart. Perhaps by his great bulk,
      his cleverness, his brains, his way of doing things. In one sense she&rsquo;s
      his slave, because she doesn&rsquo;t want to think of him, and she does. She
      wants to think of you&mdash;and she does&mdash;ah, bagosh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; remarked Carnac morosely. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you let her be under Tarboe&rsquo;s influence? Why don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac thrust out a hand that said silence. &ldquo;Denzil, I&rsquo;ll never forget
      what you&rsquo;ve told me about yourself. Some day you&rsquo;ll have to tell it to the
      priest, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tell it till I&rsquo;m on my death-bed. Then I&rsquo;ll tell it, sacre
      bapteme, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad Catholic, Denzil,&rdquo; remarked Carnac with emotion, but a smile
      upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be a bad Catholic, but the man deserved to die, and he died. What&rsquo;s
      the difference, so far&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s concerned, whether he died by
      accident, or died&mdash;as he died. It&rsquo;s me that feels the fury of the
      damned, and want my girl back every hour: and she can&rsquo;t come. But some day
      I&rsquo;ll go to M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Luke Tarboe, and tell him the truth, as I&rsquo;ve told it
      you&mdash;bagosh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;d try and kill you, if you did. That&rsquo;s the kind of man he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think if he knew the truth he&rsquo;d try and kill me&mdash;he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac paused. He did not like to say everything in his mind. &ldquo;Do you
      think he&rsquo;d say much and do little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno, I dunno, but I&rsquo;ll tell him the truth and take my chance.&rdquo;
       Suddenly he swung round and stretched out appealing hands. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you
      got any sense, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;? Don&rsquo;t you see what you should do? Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle Junia
      cares for you. I know it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen it in her eyes often&mdash;often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With sudden vehemence Carnac caught the wrists of the other. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,
      Denzil. I can&rsquo;t tell you why yet. I&rsquo;m going away. If Tarboe wants her&mdash;good&mdash;good;
      I must give her a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denzil shrank. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. Then his eyes
      fastened on Carnac&rsquo;s. Suddenly, with a strange, shining light in them, he
      added &ldquo;It will all come right for you and her. I&rsquo;ll live for that. If you
      go away, I&rsquo;ll take good care of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if&mdash;&rdquo; Carnac paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, even if he makes love to her. He&rsquo;ll want to marry her, surelee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not strange,&rdquo; remarked Carnac.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. CARNAC&rsquo;S TALK WITH HIS MOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Carnac went slowly towards his father&rsquo;s house on the hill. Fixed, as his
      mind was, upon all that had just happened, his eye took fondly from the
      gathering dusk pictures which the artist&rsquo;s mind cherishes&mdash;the long
      roadway, with the maples and pines, the stump fences; behind which lay the
      garnered fields, where the plough had made ready the way for the Fall
      wheat; the robins twittering in the scattered trees; the cooing of the
      wood-pigeon; over all, the sky in its perfect purpling blue, and far down
      the horizon the evening-star slowly climbing. He noted the lizards
      slipping through the stones; he saw where the wheel of a wagon had crushed
      some wild flower-growth; he heard the far call of a milkmaid to the
      cattle; he caught the sweet breath of decaying verdure, and through all,
      the fresh, biting air of the new-land autumn, pleasantly stinging his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something kept saying to his mind: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good. It&rsquo;s life and light,
      and all good.&rdquo; But his nerves were being tried; his whole nature was
      stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the letter from his pocket again, and read it in the fading light.
      It was native, naive, brutal, and unconsciously clever&mdash;and the girl
      who had written it was beautiful. It had only a few lines. It asked him
      why he had deserted her, his wife. It said that he would find American law
      protected the deluded stranger. It asked if he had so soon forgotten the
      kisses he had given her, and did he not realize they were married? He felt
      that, with her, beneath all, there was more than malice; there was a
      passion which would run risks to secure its end.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later he was in the room where his mother, with her strong,
      fine, lonely face, sat sewing by the window. The door opened squarely on
      her, and he saw how refined and sad, yet self-contained, was the woman who
      had given him birth. The look in her eyes warmly welcomed him. Her own
      sorrows made her sensitive to those of others, and as Carnac entered she
      saw something was vexing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lad!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beside her now, and he kissed her cheek. &ldquo;Best of all the world,&rdquo;
       he said; and he did not see that she shrank a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in trouble?&rdquo; she asked, and her hand touched his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrong she had done him long ago vexed her. It was not possible this
      boy could fit in with a life where, in one sense, he did not belong. It
      was not part of her sorrow that he had given himself to painting and
      sculpture. In her soul she believed this might be best for him in the end.
      She had a surreptitious, an almost anguished, joy in the thought that he
      and John Grier could not hit it off. It seemed natural that both men,
      ignorant of their own tragedy, believing themselves to be father and son,
      should feel for each other the torture of distance, a misunderstanding,
      which only she and one other human being understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Grier was not the boy&rsquo;s father. Carnac was the son of Barode
      Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he said: &ldquo;Mother, I know why I&rsquo;ve come to you. It&rsquo;s because
      I feel when I&rsquo;m in trouble, I get helped by being with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I help, my boy?&rdquo; she asked with a sad smile, for he had said the
      thing dearest to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m with you, I seem to get a hold on myself. I&rsquo;ve always had a
      strange feeling about you. I felt when I was a child that you&rsquo;re two
      people; one that lives on some distant, lonely prairie, silent, shadowy
      and terribly loving; and the other, a vocal person, affectionate, alert,
      good and generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but she only shook her head. After a moment he continued: &ldquo;I
      know you aren&rsquo;t happy, mother, but maybe you once were&mdash;at the
      start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got to her feet, and drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy in your love, but all the rest&mdash;is all the rest. It isn&rsquo;t
      your father&rsquo;s fault wholly. He was busy; he forgot me. Dear, dear boy,
      never give up your soul to things only, keep it for people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was naturally straight and composed; yet as she stood there, she had a
      certain lonely splendour like some soft metal burning. Among her
      fellow-citizens she had place and position, but she took no lead; she was
      always an isolated attachment of local enterprises. It was in her own
      house where her skill and adaptability had success. She had brought into
      her soul misery and martyrdom, and all martyrs are lonely and apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sharp visions of what she was really flashed through Carnac&rsquo;s mind, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, there must be something wrong with you and me. You were naturally
      a great woman, and sometimes I have a feeling I might be a great man, but
      I don&rsquo;t get started for it. I suppose, you once had an idea you&rsquo;d play a
      big part in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls have dreams,&rdquo; she answered with moist eyes, &ldquo;and at times I thought
      great things might come to me; but I married and got lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got lost?&rdquo; asked Carnac anxiously, for there was a curious note in
      her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to change the effect of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I lost myself in somebody else&rsquo;s ambitions I lost myself in the
      storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughed. &ldquo;Father was always a blizzard, wasn&rsquo;t he? Now here, now
      there, he rushed about making money, humping up his business, and yet why
      shouldn&rsquo;t you have ranged beside him. I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s the bane of life,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand each
      other. I can&rsquo;t understand why you don&rsquo;t marry Junia. You love her. You
      don&rsquo;t understand why I couldn&rsquo;t play as big a part as your father&mdash;I
      couldn&rsquo;t. He was always odd&mdash;masterful and odd, and I never could do
      just as he liked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was yearning sadness in her eyes. &ldquo;Dear Carnac, John Grier is a
      whirlwind, but he&rsquo;s also a still pool in which currents are secretly
      twisting, turning. His imagination, his power is enormous; but he&rsquo;s
      Oriental, a barbarian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he might have had twenty wives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have had twenty, and he&rsquo;d have been the same to all of them,
      because they play no part, except to make his home a place where his body
      can live. That&rsquo;s the kind of thing, when a wife finds it out, that either
      kills her slowly, or drives her mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t kill you, mother,&rdquo; remarked Carnac with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it didn&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t drive you mad,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with burning intensity. &ldquo;Oh, yes, it did&mdash;but I
      became sane again.&rdquo; She gazed out of the window, down the hillside. &ldquo;Your
      father will soon be home. Is there anything you want to say before that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac wanted to tell his tragic story, but it was difficult. He caught
      his mother&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Carnac? You are in trouble. I can see it in your eyes&mdash;I
      feel it. Is it money?&rdquo; she asked. She knew it was not, yet she could not
      help but ask. He shook his head in negation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew his answer, yet she must make these steps before she said to him:
      &ldquo;Is it a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded now. She caught his eyes and held them with her own. All the
      silence and sorrow, all the remorse and regret of the past twenty-six
      years gathered in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; he answered with emotion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve quarrelled with Junia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry her?&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;We all would like it, even your
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She leant forward with a slight burning of the cheek. &ldquo;Why,
      Carnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had determined to keep his own secret, to hide the thing which had
      vexed his life, but a sudden feeling overcame his purpose. With impulse he
      drew out the letter he had received in John Grier&rsquo;s office and handed it
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it&mdash;all I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With whitening face, she took the letter and read its few lines. It was
      written in French, with savage little flourishes and twists, and the name
      signed at the end was &ldquo;Luzanne.&rdquo; At last she handed it back, her fingers
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Luzanne, and what does it mean?&rdquo; What she had read was startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly seated himself beside her. &ldquo;I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Carnac had ended his painful story, she said to him: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible&mdash;oh,
      terrible. But there was divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they told me I couldn&rsquo;t get a divorce. Yet I wish now I&rsquo;d tried
      for it. I&rsquo;ve never heard a word from the girl till I got that letter. It
      isn&rsquo;t strange she hasn&rsquo;t moved in the thing till now. It was I that should
      have acted; and she knew that. She means business, that&rsquo;s clear, and it&rsquo;ll
      be hard to prove I didn&rsquo;t marry her with eyes wide open. It gets between
      me and my work and my plans for the future; between&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you and Junia,&rdquo; she said mournfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought
      to get a divorce for Junia&rsquo;s sake, if nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course. But I&rsquo;m not sure I could get a divorce&mdash;evidence is
      so strong against me, and it was a year ago! If I can see Luzanne again
      perhaps I can get her to tear up the marriage-lines&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I
      want. She isn&rsquo;t all bad. I must go again to New York; and Junia can wait.
      I&rsquo;m not much, I know&mdash;not worth waiting for, maybe, but I&rsquo;m in
      earnest where Junia&rsquo;s concerned. I could make a little home for her at
      once, and a better one as time went on, if she would marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence, Carnac added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to New York. Don&rsquo;t you
      think I ought to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gaunt, handsome face of the woman darkened, and then she answered:
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence again for a moment, deep and painful, and then Carnac
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I don&rsquo;t think father is well. I see a great change in him. He
      hasn&rsquo;t long to travel, and some day you&rsquo;ll have everything. He might make
      you run the business, with Tarboe as manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered slightly. &ldquo;With Tarboe&mdash;I never thought of that&mdash;with
      Tarboe!... Are you going to wait for&mdash;your father? He&rsquo;ll be here
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m off. I&rsquo;ll go down the garden, through the bushes,&rdquo; he said....
      &ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve got nearer you to-night than in all the rest of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him fondly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going away, but I hope you&rsquo;ll come back in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew she meant Junia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hope I&rsquo;ll come back in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was gone, out of the sidedoor, through the bushes, and
      down the hill, running like a boy. He had for the first time talked to his
      mother about the life of their home; the facts she told him stripped away
      the curtain that hid the secret things of life from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Grier almost burst upon his wife. He opened and shut the door
      noisily; he stamped into the dusky room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time for a light?&rdquo; he said with a quizzical nod towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short visit of Carnac had straightened her back. &ldquo;I like the twilight.
      I don&rsquo;t light up until it&rsquo;s dark, but if you wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like the twilight; you don&rsquo;t light up until it&rsquo;s dark, but if I wish&mdash;ah,
      that&rsquo;s it! Have your own way.... I&rsquo;m the breadwinner; I&rsquo;m the breadwinner;
      I&rsquo;m the fighter; I&rsquo;m the man that makes the machine go; but I don&rsquo;t like
      the twilight, and I don&rsquo;t like to wait until it&rsquo;s dark before I light up.
      So there it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing at once, but struck a match, and lit the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to give you what you want,&rdquo; she answered after a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      used to it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something animal-like in the thrust forward of his neck, in the
      anger that mounted to his eyes. When she had drawn down the blinds, he
      said to her: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she hesitated. Then she said: &ldquo;Carnac&rsquo;s been here, but that
      has naught to do with what I said. I&rsquo;ve lived with you for over thirty
      years, and I haven&rsquo;t spoken my mind often, but I&rsquo;m speaking it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never too late to mend, eh!&rdquo; he gruffly interposed. &ldquo;So Carnac&rsquo;s been
      here! Putting up his independent clack, eh? He leaves his old father to
      struggle as best he may, and doesn&rsquo;t care a damn. That&rsquo;s your son Carnac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How she longed to say to him, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your son Carnac!&rdquo; but she could
      not. A greyness crossed over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Carnac staying here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head in negation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;ll tell you about Carnac,&rdquo; he said viciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shutting
      him out of the business of my life. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken his course, let him stick to it. I&rsquo;m taking my course, and
      I&rsquo;ll stick to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came close and reached out a faltering hand. &ldquo;John, don&rsquo;t do what
      you&rsquo;ll be sorry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Fabian was born, you remember what you said? You said: &lsquo;Life&rsquo;s worth
      living now.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what did I say when Carnac was born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear, John,&rdquo; she answered, her face turning white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I said naught.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. CARNAC SAYS GOOD-BYE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fabian Grier&rsquo;s house was in a fashionable quarter of a fashionable street,
      the smallest of all built there; but it was happily placed, rather apart
      from others, at the very end of the distinguished promenade. Behind it, a
      little way up the hill, was a Roman Catholic chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surroundings of the house were rural for a city habitation. Behind it
      were commendable trees, from one of which a swing was hung. In a corner,
      which seemed to catch the sun, was a bird-cage on a pole, sought by
      pigeons and doves. In another corner was a target for the bow and
      arrow-evidence of the vigorous life of the owners of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after Carnac told his mother he was going away, the doors
      of the house were all open. Midway between breakfast and lunch, the voices
      of children sang through the dining-room bright with the morning sun. The
      children were going to the top of the mountain-the two youngsters who made
      the life of Fabian and his wife so busy. Fabian was a man of little
      speech. He was slim and dark and quiet, with a black moustache and
      smoothly brushed hair, with a body lithe and composed, yet with hands
      broad, strong, stubborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Junia stood by the dining-room table and looked at the alert, expectant
      children, she wished she also was going now to the mountain-top. But that
      could not be&mdash;not yet. Carnac had sent a note saying he wished to see
      her, and she had replied through Denzil that her morning would be spent
      with her sister. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she remarked to herself. &ldquo;What is it?
      There&rsquo;s nothing wrong. Yet I feel everything upside down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face turned slowly towards the wide mountain; it caught the light upon
      the steeple of the Catholic chapel. She shuddered slightly, and an
      expression came into her shadowed eyes not belonging to her personality,
      which was always buoyant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood absorbed, her mind in a maze of perplexity, a sigh broke from
      her lips. She suddenly had a conviction about Carnac; she felt his coming
      might bring a crisis; that what he might say must influence her whole
      life. Carnac&mdash;she threw back her head. Suddenly a sweet, appealing,
      intoxicating look crossed her face. Carnac! Yes, there was a man, a man of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe got his effects by the impetuous rush of a personality; Carnac by
      something that haunted, that made him more popular absent than present.
      Carnac compelled thought. When he was away she wanted him; when he was
      near she liked to quarrel with him. When they were together, one moment
      she wanted to take his hands in her hands, and in the next she wanted to
      push him over some great cliff&mdash;he was so maddening. He provoked the
      devil in her; yet he made her sing the song of Eden. What was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she asked the question she heard a firm step on the path. It was
      Carnac. She turned and stood waiting, leaning against the table, watching
      the door through which he presently came. He was dressed in grey. His coat
      was buttoned. He carried a soft grey hat, and somehow his face gave her a
      feeling that he had come to say good-bye. It startled her; and yet, though
      she was tempted to grip her breast, she did not. Presently she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a very idle man. Why aren&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at work,&rdquo; Carnac said cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work is not all paint and canvas of course. There has to be the thinking
      beforehand. Well, of what are you thinking now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the evening train to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was turned away from her at the instant, because he did not wish
      to see the effect of his words. He would have seen that apprehension came
      to her eyes. Her mouth opened in quick amazement. It was all too
      startling. He was going&mdash;for how long?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you going?&rdquo; she asked, when she had recovered her poise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see I haven&rsquo;t quite learned my painting yet, and I must study
      in great Art centres where one isn&rsquo;t turned down by one&rsquo;s own judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ananias!&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Ananias!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say I&rsquo;m a liar?&rdquo; he asked, flushing a little, though there was
      intense inquiry in his eyes. &ldquo;Because I think it. It isn&rsquo;t your work only
      that&rsquo;s taking you away.&rdquo; Suddenly she laughed. &ldquo;What a fool you are,
      Carnac! You&rsquo;re not a good actor. You&rsquo;re not going away for work&rsquo;s sake
      only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for work&rsquo;s sake only&mdash;that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a mess, Junia. I&rsquo;ve made some mistakes in my life, and I&rsquo;m going
      to try and put one of them right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anybody trying to do you harm?&rdquo; she asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, somebody&rsquo;s trying to hurt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt him,&rdquo; she rejoined sharply, and her eyes fastened his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to say there was no him in the matter, but reason steadied
      him, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, Junia. I wish I could tell you, but I can&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s to
      be done must be done by myself alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it ought to be done well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an instant&rsquo;s impulse he moved towards her. She went to the window,
      however, and she said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Fabian. You&rsquo;ll be glad of that. You&rsquo;ll want
      to say good-bye to him and Sibyl.&rdquo; She ran from him to the front door.
      &ldquo;Fabian&mdash;Fabian, here&rsquo;s a bad boy who wants to tell you things he
      won&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo; With these words she went into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll tell me,&rdquo; came Fabian&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards the two men met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the trouble, Carnac?&rdquo; asked Fabian in a somewhat challenging
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;for how long?&rdquo; Fabian asked quizzically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;a
      year, perhaps. I want to make myself a better artist, and also free
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now his eyes were on Junia in her summer-time recreation, and her voice,
      humming a light-opera air, was floating to him through the autumn morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has something got you in its grip, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the victim of a reckless past, like you.&rdquo; Something provocative was
      in his voice and in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was my past reckless?&rdquo; asked Fabian with sullen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never so reckless as mine. You fought, quarrelled, hit, sold and bought
      again, and now you&rsquo;re out against your father, fighting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to come out or be crushed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure you won&rsquo;t be crushed now you&rsquo;re out. He plays boldly, and
      he knows his game. One or the other of you must prevail, and I think it
      won&rsquo;t be you, Fabian. John Grier does as much thinking in an hour as most
      of us do in a month, and with Tarboe he&rsquo;ll beat you dead. Tarboe is young;
      he&rsquo;s got the vitality of a rhinoceros. He knows the business from the bark
      on the tree. He&rsquo;s a flyer, is Tarboe, and you might have been in Tarboe&rsquo;s
      place and succeeded to the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabian threw out his arms. &ldquo;But no! Father might live another ten years&mdash;though
      I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t have stood it. He was lapping me in
      the mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t lap Tarboe in the mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have lapped you in the mud, because you&rsquo;ve got
      imagination, and you think wide and long when you want to. But I&rsquo;m
      middle-class in business. I&rsquo;ve got no genius for the game. He didn&rsquo;t see
      my steady qualities were what was needed. He wanted me to be like himself,
      an eagle, and I was only a robin red-breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his eyes flashed and his teeth set. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t stand him,
      wouldn&rsquo;t put up with his tyranny. You wanted to live your own life, and
      you&rsquo;re doing it. When he bought me out, what was there for me to do but go
      into the only business I knew, with the only big man in the business,
      besides John Grier. I&rsquo;ve as good blood as he&rsquo;s got in his veins. I do
      business straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want me to do it straight. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons we fell
      out. John Grier&rsquo;s a big, ruthless trickster. I wasn&rsquo;t. I was for playing
      the straight game, and I played it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got his own way now. He&rsquo;s got a man who wouldn&rsquo;t blink at
      throttling his own brother, if it&rsquo;d do him any good. Tarboe is iron and
      steel; he&rsquo;s the kind that succeeds. He likes to rule, and he&rsquo;s going to
      get what he wants mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;re going away?&rdquo; asked Fabian. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;ll be
      just as well not to go, if Tarboe is going to get all he wants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Tarboe come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He came on urgent business. There was trouble between our two
      river-driving camps. He wanted my help to straighten things out, and he
      got it. He&rsquo;s pretty quick on the move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted you to let him settle it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He settled it, and I agreed. He knows how to handle men; I&rsquo;ll say that
      for him. He can run reckless on the logs like a river-driver; he can break
      a jam like an expert. He&rsquo;s not afraid of man, or log, or devil. That&rsquo;s his
      training. He got that training from John Grier&rsquo;s firm under another name.
      I used to know him by reputation long before he took my place in the
      business&mdash;my place and yours. You got loose from the business only to
      get tied up in knots of your own tying,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;What it is I don&rsquo;t
      know, but you say you&rsquo;re in trouble and I believe you.&rdquo; Suddenly a sharp
      look came to his face. &ldquo;Is it a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ought to know how to handle a woman. You&rsquo;re popular with women.
      My wife&rsquo;ll never hear a word against you. I don&rsquo;t know how you do it.
      We&rsquo;re so little alike, it makes me feel sometimes we&rsquo;re not brothers. I
      don&rsquo;t know where you get your temperament from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where I got it, it&rsquo;s mine. I want to earn my own
      living, and I&rsquo;m doing it.&rdquo; Admiration came into Fabian&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t borrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t beg or steal. Mother has given me money, and I&rsquo;m spending my
      own little legacy, all but five thousand dollars of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabian came up to his brother slowly. &ldquo;If you know what&rsquo;s good for you,
      you&rsquo;ll stay where you are. You&rsquo;re not the only man that ought to be
      married. Tarboe&rsquo;s a strong man, and he&rsquo;ll be father&rsquo;s partner. He&rsquo;s
      handsome in his rough way too, is Tarboe. He knows what he wants, and
      means to have it, and this is a free country. Our girls, they have their
      own way. Why don&rsquo;t you settle it now? Why don&rsquo;t you marry Junia, and take
      her away with you&mdash;if she&rsquo;ll have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;even if she&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An uneasy smile hung at Carnac&rsquo;s lips. He suddenly caught Fabian&rsquo;s
      shoulder in a strong grip. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been close friends, Fabian. We&rsquo;ve
      always been at sixes and sevens, and yet I feel you&rsquo;d rather do me a good
      turn than a bad one. Let me ask you this&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll not believe
      anything bad of me till you&rsquo;ve heard what I&rsquo;ve got to say. Will you do
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabian nodded. &ldquo;Of course. But if I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on myself,
      Carnac. Junia&rsquo;s worth running risks for. She&rsquo;s got more brains than my
      wife and me together, and she bosses us; but with you, it&rsquo;s different. I
      think you&rsquo;d boss her. You&rsquo;re unexpected; you&rsquo;re daring; and you&rsquo;re
      reckless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I certainly am reckless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why aren&rsquo;t you reckless now? You&rsquo;re going away. Why, you haven&rsquo;t
      even told her you love her. The other man&mdash;is here, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      seen him look at her? I know by the way she speaks of him how she feels.
      Besides, he&rsquo;s a great masterful creature. Don&rsquo;t be a fool! Have a try ...
      Junia&mdash;Junia,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure in the garden with the flowers turned. There was a flicker of
      understanding in the rare eyes. The girl held up a bunch of flowers high
      like a torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, my children,&rdquo; she called, and, with a laugh, she ran forward
      through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want, Fabian?&rdquo; she asked, conscious that in Carnac&rsquo;s face
      was consternation. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; she added, with a slight
      flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing for me, but for Carnac&mdash;&rdquo; Fabian stretched out a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed brusquely. &ldquo;Oh, Carnac! Carnac! Well, I&rsquo;ve been making him
      this bouquet.&rdquo; She held it out towards him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a farewell bouquet for
      his little journey in the world. Take it, Carnac, with everybody&rsquo;s love&mdash;with
      Fabian&rsquo;s love, with Sibyl&rsquo;s love, with my love. Take it, and good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a laugh she caught up her hat from the table, and a moment later she
      was in the street making for the mountain-side up which the children had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac placed the bouquet upon the table. Then he turned to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a damn mess you make of things, Fabian!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. CARNAC&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s happened since I&rsquo;ve been gone, mother?&rdquo; asked Carnac. &ldquo;Is
      nobody we&rsquo;re interested in married, or going to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was spring-time eight months after Carnac had vanished from Montreal,
      and the sun of late April was melting the snow upon the hills, bringing
      out the smell of the sprouting verdure and the exultant song of the birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother replied sorrowfully: &ldquo;Junia&rsquo;s been away since last fall. Her
      aunt in the West was taken ill, and she&rsquo;s been with her ever since. Tell
      me, dearest, is everything all right now? Are you free to do what you
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head morosely. &ldquo;No, everything&rsquo;s all wrong. I blundered, and
      I&rsquo;m paying the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t find Luzanne Larue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I found her, but it was no good. I said there was divorce, and she
      replied I&rsquo;d done it with my eyes open, and had signed our names in the
      book of the hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Carnac Grier and divorce would not be
      possible. Also, I&rsquo;d let things go for a year, and what jury would give me
      relief! I consulted a lawyer. He said she had the game in her hands, and
      that a case could be put up that would discredit me with jury or judge, so
      there it is.... Well, bad as she is, she&rsquo;s fond of me in her way. I don&rsquo;t
      think she&rsquo;s ever gone loose with any man; this is only a craze, I&rsquo;m sure.
      She wanted me, and she meant to have me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother protested: &ldquo;No pure, straight, honest girl would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughed bitterly, and interrupted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way, mother.
      The girl was brought up among exiles and political criminals in the
      purlieu of Montmartre. What&rsquo;s possible in one place is impossible in
      another. Devil as she is, I want to do her justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she wear a wedding-ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but she used my name as her own: I saw it on the paper door-plate.
      She said she would wait awhile longer, but if at the end of six months I
      didn&rsquo;t do my duty, she&rsquo;d see the thing through here among my own people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six months&mdash;it&rsquo;s overdue now!&rdquo; She said in agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded helplessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in hell as things are. There&rsquo;s only this to be
      said: She&rsquo;s done naught yet, and she mayn&rsquo;t do aught!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were roused by the click of the gate. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your father&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      John Grier,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard the front door open and shut, a footstep in the hall, then the
      door opened and John Grier came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preoccupation, abstraction, filled his face, as he came forward. It was as
      though he was looking at something distant that both troubled and pleased
      him. When he saw Carnac he stopped, his face flushed. For an instant he
      stood unmoving, and then he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come back, Carnac. When did you get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Carnac released his hand from John Grier&rsquo;s cold clasp, he said: &ldquo;A
      couple of hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man scrutinized him sharply, carefully. &ldquo;Getting on&mdash;making
      money?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Got your hand in the pocket of the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much about the pocket of the world,
      but they like my work in London and New York. I don&rsquo;t get Royal Academy
      prices, but I do pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got some pride, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always proud when anybody outside Montreal mentions your name! It
      makes me feel I have a place in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ve made your own place,&rdquo; said the other, pleasure coming to his
      cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your own shovel and pick to make wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care little about wealth. All I want is enough to clothe and feed me,
      and give me a little home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little home! Yes, it&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; remarked the other, as he seated himself
      in his big chair by the table. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed until there could only be seen a slit of fire
      between the lids, and a bitter smile came to his lips. He had told his
      wife a year ago that he had cut Carnac out of all business consideration.
      So now, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarboe&rsquo;s taken your place in the business, Carnac. Look out he doesn&rsquo;t
      take your little home too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had near a year, and he hasn&rsquo;t done it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that through any virtue of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; answered Carnac ironically. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been away; he&rsquo;s been
      here. He&rsquo;s had everything with him. Why hasn&rsquo;t he pulled it off then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pulls off everything he plans. He&rsquo;s never fallen over his own feet
      since he&rsquo;s been with me, and, if I can help it, he won&rsquo;t have a fall when
      I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he got to his feet; a fit of passion seized him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Junia to
      me&mdash;nothing! I&rsquo;ve every reason to dislike her, but she comes and goes
      as if the place belonged to her. She comes to my office; she comes to this
      house; she visits Fabian; she tries to boss everybody. Why don&rsquo;t you
      regularize it? Why don&rsquo;t you marry her, and then we&rsquo;ll know where we are?
      She&rsquo;s got more brains than anybody else in our circle. She&rsquo;s got tact and
      humour. Her sister&rsquo;s a fool; she&rsquo;s done harm. Junia&rsquo;s got sense. What are
      you waiting for? I wouldn&rsquo;t leave her for Tarboe! Look here, Carnac, I
      wanted you to do what Tarboe&rsquo;s doing, and you wouldn&rsquo;t. You cheeked me&mdash;so
      I took him in. He&rsquo;s made good every foot of the way. He&rsquo;s a wonder. I&rsquo;m a
      millionaire. I&rsquo;m two times a millionaire, and I got the money honestly. I
      gave one-third of it to Fabian, and he left us. I paid him in cash, and
      now he&rsquo;s fighting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac bristled up: &ldquo;What else could he do? He might have lived on the
      interest of the money, and done nothing. You trained him for business, and
      he&rsquo;s gone on with the business you trained him for. There are other lumber
      firms. Why don&rsquo;t you quarrel with them? Why do you drop on Fabian as if he
      was dirt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belloc&rsquo;s a rogue and a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make? Isn&rsquo;t it a fair fight? Don&rsquo;t you want
      anybody to sit down or stand up till you tell them to? Is it your view you
      shall tyrannize, browbeat, batter, and then that everybody you love, or
      pretend to love, shall bow down before you as though you were eternal law?
      I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m making my own life. You gave me a chance in your
      business, and I tried it, and declined it. You gave it to some one else,
      and I approved of it. What more do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a new spirit of defiance awoke in him. &ldquo;What I owe you I don&rsquo;t
      know, but if you&rsquo;ll make out what you think is due, for what you&rsquo;ve done
      for me in the way of food and clothes and education, I&rsquo;ll see you get it
      all. Meanwhile, I want to be free to move and do as I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Grier sat down in his chair again, cold, merciless, with a scornful
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have made a great business man if you&rsquo;d
      come with me. You refused. I don&rsquo;t understand you&mdash;I never did.
      There&rsquo;s only one thing that&rsquo;s alike in us, and that&rsquo;s a devilish
      self-respect, self-assertion, self-dependence. There&rsquo;s nothing more to be
      said between us&mdash;nothing that counts. Don&rsquo;t get into a passion,
      Carnac. It don&rsquo;t become you. Good-night&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his mother&rsquo;s face produced a great change in Carnac. Horror,
      sorrow, remorse, were all there. He looked at John Grier; then at his
      mother. The spirit of the bigger thing crept into his heart. He put his
      arm around his mother and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, mother,&rdquo; he said. Then he went to his father and held out a
      hand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my speaking what I think?&rdquo; he continued, with a
      smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a lot to try me. Shake hands with me, father. We haven&rsquo;t
      found the way to walk together yet. Perhaps it will come; I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again a flash of passion seized John Grier. He got to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
      shake hands with you, not to night. You can&rsquo;t put the knife in and turn it
      round, and then draw it out and put salve on the wound and say
      everything&rsquo;s all right. Everything&rsquo;s all wrong. My family&rsquo;s been my curse.
      First one, then another, and then all against me,&mdash;my whole family
      against me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped back in his chair sunk in gloomy reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;It will all come right some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards he was gone. His mother sat down in her seat by the
      window; his father sat brooding by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac stole down the hillside, his heart burning in him. It had not been
      a successful day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE HOUSE OF THE THREE TREES
    </h2>
    <p>
      During Carnac&rsquo;s absence, Denzil had lain like an animal, watching, as it
      were, the doorway out of which Tarboe came and went. His gloom at last
      became fanaticism. During all the eight months of Carnac&rsquo;s absence he
      prowled in the precincts of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Junia was at home he had been watchfully determined to save her from
      Tarboe, if possible. He had an obsession of wrong-mindedness which is
      always attached to crime. Though Luke Tarboe had done him no wrong, and
      was entitled, if he could, to win Junia for himself, to the mind of Denzil
      the stain of his brother&rsquo;s past was on Tarboe&rsquo;s life. He saw Tarboe and
      Junia meet; he knew Tarboe put himself in her way, and he was right in
      thinking that the girl, with a mind for comedy and coquetry, was drawn
      instinctively to danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly the massive presence of Tarboe, his animal-like, bull-headed
      persistency, the fun at his big mouth and the light in his bold eye had a
      kind of charm for her. It was as though she placed herself within the
      danger zone to try her strength, her will; and she had done it without
      real loss. More than once, as she waited in the office for old John Grier
      to come, she had a strange, intuitive feeling that Tarboe might suddenly
      grip her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed at the thought of it; it seemed so absurd. Yet that very
      thought had passed through the mind of the man. He was by nature a hunter;
      he was self-willed and reckless. No woman had ever moved him in his life
      until this girl crossed his path, and he reached out towards her with the
      same will to control that he had used in the business of life. Yet, while
      this brute force suggested physical control of the girl, it had its
      immediate reaction. She was so fine, so delicate, and yet so full of
      summer and the free unfettered life of the New World, so unimpassioned
      physically, yet so passionate in mind and temperament, that he felt he
      must atone for the wild moment&rsquo;s passion&mdash;the passion of possession,
      which had made him long to crush her to his breast. There was nothing
      physically repulsive in it; it was the wild, strong life of conquering
      man, of which he had due share. For, as he looked at her sitting in his
      office, her perfect health, her slim boyishness, her exquisite lines and
      graceful turn of hand, arm and body, or the flower-like turn of the neck,
      were the very harmony and poetry of life. But she was terribly provoking
      too; and he realized that she was an unconscious coquette, that her spirit
      loved mastery as his did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil could not know this, however. It was impossible for him to analyse
      the natures of these two people. He had instinct, but not enough to judge
      the whole situation, and so for two months after Carnac disappeared he had
      lived a life of torture. Again and again he had determined to tell Junia
      the story of Tarboe&rsquo;s brother, but instinctive delicacy stopped him. He
      could not tell her the terrible story which had robbed him of all he loved
      and had made him the avenger of the dead. A half-dozen times after she
      came back from John Grier&rsquo;s office, with slightly heightening colour, and
      the bright interest in her eyes, and had gone about the garden fondling
      the flowers, he had started towards her; but had stopped short before her
      natural modesty. Besides, why should he tell her? She had her own life to
      make, her own row to hoe. Yet, as the weeks passed, it seemed he must
      break upon this dangerous romance; and then suddenly she went to visit her
      sick aunt in the Far West. Denzil did not know, however, that, in John
      Grier&rsquo;s office as she had gone over figures of a society in which she was
      interested, the big hand of Tarboe had suddenly closed upon her fingers,
      and that his head bent down beside hers for one swift instant, as though
      he would whisper to her. Then she quickly detached herself, yet smiled at
      him, as she said reprovingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to do that. You&rsquo;ll spoil our friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not wait longer. As he stretched out his hands to her, his face
      had gone pale: she vanished through the doorway, and in forty-eight hours
      was gone to her sick aunt. The autumn had come and the winter and the
      spring, and the spring was almost gone when she returned; and, with her
      return, Catastrophe lifted its head in the person of Denzil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was imperative instinct that brought Junia back in an hour
      coincident with Carnac&rsquo;s return&mdash;perhaps. In any case, there it was.
      They had both returned, as it were, in the self-same hour, each having
      endured a phase of emotion not easy to put on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil told her of Carnac&rsquo;s return, and she went to the house where
      Carnac&rsquo;s mother lived, and was depressed at what she saw and felt. Mrs.
      Grier&rsquo;s face was not that of one who had good news. The long arms almost
      hurt when they embraced her. Yet Carnac was a subject of talk between them&mdash;open,
      clear eyed talk. The woman did not know what to say, except to praise her
      boy, and the girl asked questions cheerfully, unimportantly as to sound,
      but with every nerve tingling. There was, however, so much of the
      comedienne in her, so much coquetry, that only one who knew her well could
      have seen the things that troubled her behind all. As though to punish
      herself, she began to speak of Tarboe, and Mrs. Grier&rsquo;s face clouded; she
      spoke more of Tarboe, and the gloom deepened. Then, with the mask of
      coquetry still upon her she left Carnac&rsquo;s mother abashed, sorrowful and
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe had called in her absence. Entering the garden, he saw Denzil at
      work. At the click of the gate Denzil turned, and came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t home,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out. She ain&rsquo;t here. She&rsquo;s up at
      Mr. Grier&rsquo;s house, bien sur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Tarboe Denzil&rsquo;s words were offensive. It was none of Denzil&rsquo;s business
      whether he came or went in this house, or what his relations with Junia
      were. Democrat though he was, he did not let democracy transgress his
      personal associations. He knew that the Frenchman was less likely to say
      and do the crude thing than the Britisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe knew of the position held by Denzil in the Shale household; and
      that long years of service had given him authority. All this, however,
      could not atone for the insolence of Denzil&rsquo;s words, but he had controlled
      men too long to act rashly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will Mademoiselle be back?&rdquo; he asked, putting a hand on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; answered Denzil, with an antipathetic eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a damn fool. Tell me the hour when you think she will be at
      home. Before dinner&mdash;within the next sixty minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle is under no orders. She didn&rsquo;t say when she would be back&mdash;but
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll be back for dinner?&rdquo; asked Tarboe, smothering his
      anger, but get to get his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll be back for dinner!&rdquo; and he drove the spade into the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll sit down and wait.&rdquo; Tarboe made for the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil presently trotted after and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe turned round. &ldquo;Well, what have you got to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better be said in my house, not here,&rdquo; replied Denzil. His face was pale,
      but there was fire in his eyes. There was no danger of violence, and, if
      there were, Tarboe could deal with it. Why should there be violence? Why
      should that semi-insanity in Denzil&rsquo;s eyes disturb him? The one thing to
      do was to forge ahead. He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; he asked presently, as they passed through the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my little house by the Three Trees. I&rsquo;ve got things I&rsquo;d like to show
      you, and there&rsquo;s some things I&rsquo;d like to say. You are a big hulk of a man,
      and I&rsquo;m nobody, but yet I&rsquo;ve been close to you and yours in my time&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      so, for sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been close to me and mine in your time, eh? I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t know it. Nobody knew it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve kept it to myself. Your
      family wasn&rsquo;t all first-class&mdash;but no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They soon reached the plain board-house, with the well-laid foundation of
      stone, by the big Three Trees. Inside the little spare, undecorated room,
      Tarboe looked round. It was all quiet and still enough. It was like a
      lodge in the wilderness. Somehow, the atmosphere of it made him feel apart
      and lonely. Perhaps that was a little due to the timbered ceiling, to the
      walls with cedar scantlings showing, to the crude look of everything-the
      head of a moose, the skins hanging down the sides of the walls, the smell
      of the cedar, and the swift movement of a tame red squirrel, which ran up
      the walls and over the floor and along the chimney-piece, for Denzil
      avoided the iron stove so common in these new cold lands, and remained
      faithful to a huge old-fashioned mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Denzil faced him, having closed the door. &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d been near
      to your family and you didn&rsquo;t believe me. Sit down, please to, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seating himself with a little curt laugh, Tarboe waved a hand as though to
      say: &ldquo;Go ahead. I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult for Denzil to begin. He walked up and down the room,
      muttering and shaking his head. Presently, however, he made the Sign of
      the Cross upon himself, and, leaning against the wall, and opposite to
      Tarboe, he began the story he had told Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      His description of his dead fiancee had flashes of poetry and excruciating
      touches of life:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had no mother, and there was lots of things she didn&rsquo;t know because
      of that&mdash;ah, plenty! She had to learn, and she brought on her own
      tragedy by not knowing that men, even when good to look at, can&rsquo;t be
      trusted; that every place, even in the woods and the fields where every
      one seems safe to us outdoor people, ain&rsquo;t safe&mdash;but no. So she
      trusted, and then one day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the next five minutes the words poured from him in moroseness. He drew
      a picture of the lonely wood, of the believing credulous girl and the
      masterful, intellectual, skilful man. In the midst of it Tarboe started.
      The description of the place and of the man was familiar. He had a vision
      of a fair young girl encompassed by clanger; he saw her in the man&rsquo;s arms;
      the man&rsquo;s lips to hers, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God&mdash;good God!&rdquo; he said twice, for a glimmer of the truth
      struck him. He knew what his brother had done. He could conceive the
      revenge to his brother&rsquo;s amorous hand. He listened till the whole tale was
      told; till the death of the girl in the pond at home&mdash;back in her own
      little home. Then the rest of the story shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The verdict of the coroner&rsquo;s court was that he was shot by his own hand&mdash;by
      accident,&rdquo; said Denzil. &ldquo;That was the coroner&rsquo;s verdict, but yes! Well, he
      was shot by his own gun, but not by his own hand. There was some one who
      loved the girl, took toll. The world did not know, and does not know, but
      you know&mdash;you&mdash;you, the brother of him that spoiled a woman&rsquo;s
      life! Do you think such a man should live? She was the sweetest girl that
      ever lived, and she loved me! She told me the truth&mdash;and he died by
      his own gun&mdash;in the woods; but it wasn&rsquo;t accident&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t
      accident&mdash;but no! The girl had gone, but behind her was some one that
      loved her, and he settled it once for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he had told the story, Denzil&rsquo;s body seemed to contract; his face took
      on an insane expression. It was ghastly pale, but his eyes ware aflame.
      His arms stretched out with grim realism as he told of the death of
      Almeric Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the whole truth, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve told it you at last. I&rsquo;ve never
      been sorry for killing him&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never. Now, what
      are you going to do about it&mdash;you&mdash;his brother&mdash;you that
      come here making love too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the truth dawned upon Tarboe, his great figure stretched itself. A
      black spirit possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Denzil had finished, Tarboe stood up. There was dementia, cruelty,
      stark purpose in his eyes, in every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I going to do? You killed my brother! Well, I&rsquo;m going to kill
      you. God blast your soul&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to kill you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly swooped upon Denzil, his fingers clenched about the thick
      throat, insane rage was on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a knock at the door, it opened, and Carnac
      stepped inside. He realized the situation and rushed forward. There was no
      time to struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You devil&mdash;let him go.&rdquo; Then with all his
      might, he struck Tarboe in the face. The blow brought understanding back
      to Tarboe. His fingers loosed from the Frenchman&rsquo;s throat, and Carnac
      caught Denzil as he fell backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;Good God, Tarboe! Wasn&rsquo;t it enough for your
      brother to take this man&rsquo;s love without your trying to take his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac&rsquo;s blow brought conviction to Tarboe, whose terrible rage passed
      away. He wiped the blood from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the little devil all right?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil spoke: &ldquo;Yes. This is the second time M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac has saved my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac intervened. &ldquo;Tell me, Tarboe, what shall you do, now you know the
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Tarboe thrust out a hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the truth,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this Carnac knew that Denzil was safe from the law.

      CHAPTER XV. CARNAC AND JUNIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tarboe did not see Junia that evening nor for many evenings, but Carnac
      and Junia met the next day in her own house. He came on her as she was
      arranging the table for midday dinner. She had taken up again the threads
      of housekeeping, cheering her father, helping the old French-woman cook&mdash;a
      huge creature who moved like a small mountain, and was a tyrant in her way
      to the old cheerful avocat, whose life had been a struggle for existence,
      yet whose one daughter had married a rich lumberman, and whose other
      daughter could marry wealth, handsomeness and youth, if she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carnac saw Junia she was entering the dining-room with flowers and
      fruit, and he recalled the last time they met, when she had thrust the
      farewell bouquet of flowers into his hand. That was in the early autumn,
      and this was in late spring, and the light in her face was as glowing as
      then. A remembrance of the scene came to the minds of both, and the girl
      gave a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Carnac,&rdquo; she said gaily, her cheek flushing, her eyes warm
      with colour: &ldquo;well, I sent you away with flowers. Did they bring you
      luck?&rdquo; She looked him steadily in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they brought me a perfect remembrance&mdash;of one who has always
      been to me like the balm of Gilead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soothing and stimulating, eh?&rdquo; she asked, as she put the flowers on the
      table and gave him her hand&mdash;no, she suddenly gave him both hands
      with a rush of old-time friendship, which robbed it of all personal
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he held her hands. He felt them tremble in his warm clasp,
      the delicate, shivering pulsation of youth, the womanly feeling. It was
      for an instant only, because she withdrew her fingers. Then she caught up
      an apple from the dish she had brought in, and tossed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a good boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have been a good boy, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, chiefly by remembering a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty compliment&mdash;meant for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, meant for you. I think you understand me better than anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He noticed her forehead wrinkle slightly, and a faint, incredulous smile
      come to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think I understand you, Carnac,&rdquo; she said, over her shoulder,
      as she arranged dishes on the sideboard. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think I know you
      well. There&rsquo;s no Book of Revelations of your life except in your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly turned full on him, and held his eyes. &ldquo;Carnac, I think your
      face looks honest. I&rsquo;ve always thought so, and yet I think you&rsquo;re
      something of a scamp, a rogue and a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was determination at her lips, through which, though only slightly
      apart, her beautiful teeth, so straight, so regular, showed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      play fair. What&rsquo;s the good of having a friend if you don&rsquo;t tell your
      friend your troubles? And you&rsquo;ve been in trouble, Carnac, and you&rsquo;re
      fighting it through alone. Is that wise? You ought to tell some bad man,
      or some good woman&mdash;if they&rsquo;re both clever&mdash;what&rsquo;s vexing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the bad clever man would probably think out something that would
      have the same effect as the good clever woman. They never would think out
      the same thing, but each &lsquo;d think out what would help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve just said I&rsquo;m a bad clever man. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I work out my
      own trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re bad enough,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not clever enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure though about the woman. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll tell
      the good clever woman some day and let her help me, if she can. But I&rsquo;d
      warn her it won&rsquo;t be easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s another woman in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. He could not let her know the truth, yet he was sure
      she would come to know it one way or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment she leaned over the table and stretched a hand to arrange
      something. The perfection of her poise, the beauty of her lines, the charm
      of her face seized Carnac, and, with an impulse, he ran his arm around her
      waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junia&mdash;Junia!&rdquo; he said in a voice of rash, warm feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was like a wild bird caught in its flight. A sudden stillness held
      her, and then she turned her head towards him, subdued inquiry in her
      eyes. For a moment only she looked&mdash;and then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your arm away, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conviction that he ought not to make any sign of love to her broke his
      sudden passion. He drew back ashamed, yet defiant, rebuked, yet
      rebellious. It was like a challenge to her. A sarcastic smile crossed her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a creature of impulses you are, Carnac! When we were children the
      day you saved Denzil years ago you flung your arms around me and kissed
      me. I didn&rsquo;t understand anything then, and what&rsquo;s more I don&rsquo;t think you
      did. You were a wilful, hazardous boy, and went your way taking the
      flowers in the garden that didn&rsquo;t belong to you. Yet after all these
      years, with an impulse behind which there is nothing&mdash;nothing at all,
      you repeat that incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly passion seemed to possess her. &ldquo;How dare you trifle with things
      that mean so much! Have you learned nothing since I saw you last? Can
      nothing teach you, Carnac? Can you not learn how to play the big part? If
      you weren&rsquo;t grown up, do you know what I would do? I would slap the face
      of an insolent, thoughtless, hopeless boy.&rdquo; Then her temper seemed to
      pass. She caught up an apple again and thrust it into his hand. &ldquo;Go and
      eat that, Adam. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll make you wise like the old Adam. He put his
      faults upon a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Carnac. &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you would do, but you mustn&rsquo;t play that sort of game with a
      good woman.&rdquo; She burst out laughing. &ldquo;For a man you&rsquo;re a precious fool! I
      don&rsquo;t think I want to see you again. You don&rsquo;t improve. You&rsquo;re full of
      horrid impulses.&rdquo; Her indignation came back. &ldquo;How dare you put your arm
      around me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the impulse of my heart. I can say no more; if I could I would.
      There&rsquo;s something I should like to tell you, but I mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He put the
      apple down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the other woman, I suppose,&rdquo; she said coldly, the hot indignation
      gone from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked her steadfastly in the eyes. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t trust me&mdash;if you
      won&rsquo;t trust me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always trusted you,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t trust you now. Don&rsquo;t
      you understand that a good girl hates conduct like yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly with anger he turned upon her. &ldquo;Yes, I understand everything, but
      you don&rsquo;t understand. Why won&rsquo;t you believe that the reason I won&rsquo;t tell
      you my trouble is that it&rsquo;s best you shouldn&rsquo;t know? You&rsquo;re a young girl;
      you don&rsquo;t know life; you haven&rsquo;t seen it as I&rsquo;ve seen it&mdash;in the
      sewage, in the ditch, on the road, on the mountain and in the bog. I want
      you to keep faith with your old friend who doesn&rsquo;t care what the rest of
      the world thinks, but who wants your confidence. Trust me&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      condemn me. Believe me, I haven&rsquo;t been wanton. Won&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of egotism was alive in her. She knew how much she had denied
      herself in the past months. She did not know whether she loved him, but
      injured pride tortured her. Except in a dance and in sports at a picnic or
      recreation-ground no man had ever put his arms around her. No man except
      Carnac, and that he had done it was like a lash upon the raw skinless
      flesh. If she had been asked by the Almighty whether she loved Carnac, she
      would have said she did not know. This was not a matter of love; but of
      womanhood, of self-respect, of the pride of one who cannot ask for herself
      what she wants in the field of love, who must wait to be wooed and won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m straight,&rdquo; he said in protest. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m no
      good, that I&rsquo;m a fraud. You&rsquo;re wrong. Believe me, that is the truth.&rdquo; He
      came closer up to her. &ldquo;Junia, if you&rsquo;ll stand by me, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come
      out right. I&rsquo;ve been caught in a mesh I can&rsquo;t untangle yet, but it can be
      untangled, and when it is, you shall know everything, because then you&rsquo;ll
      understand. I can free myself from the tangle, but it could never be
      explained&mdash;not so the world would believe. I haven&rsquo;t trifled with
      you. I would believe in you even if I saw, or thought I saw, the signs of
      wrong in you. I would know that at heart you were good. I put my faith in
      you long ago&mdash;last year I staked all on your friendship, and I
      haven&rsquo;t been deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her, his soul in his eyes. There was truth in his smile, and
      she realized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment, she put out a hand and pushed him gently from her. &ldquo;Go
      away, Carnac, please&mdash;now,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards he was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. JOHN GRIER MAKES A JOURNEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Grier&rsquo;s business had beaten all past records. Tarboe was everywhere:
      on the river, in the saw-mills, in the lumber-yards, in the office. Health
      and strength and goodwill were with him, and he had the confidence of all
      men in the lumber-world. It was rumoured that he was a partner of John
      Grier, and it was a good thing for him as well as for the business. He was
      no partner, however; he was on a salary with a bonus percentage of the
      profits; but that increased his vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when he longed for the backwoods life; when the smell of
      the pines and the firs and the juniper got into his nostrils; when he
      heard, in imagination, the shouts of the river-men as they chopped down
      the trees, sawed the boles into standard lengths, and plunged the big
      timbers into the stream, or round the fire at night made call upon the
      spirit of recreation. In imagination, he felt the timbers creaking and
      straining under his feet; he smelt the rich soup from the cook&rsquo;s caboose;
      he drank basins of tea from well-polished metal; he saw the ugly rows in
      the taverns, where men let loose from river duty tried to regain civilian
      life by means of liquor and cards; he heard the stern thud of a hard fist
      against a piece of wood; he saw twenty men spring upon another twenty with
      rage in their faces; he saw hundreds of men arrived in civilization once
      again striking for their homes and loved ones, storming with life. He saw
      the door flung open, and the knee-booted, corduroyed river-man, with red
      sash around his waist and gold rings in his ears, seize the woman he
      called wife and swing her to him with a hungry joy; he saw the children
      pushed gently here, or roughly, but playfully, tossed in the air and
      caught again; but he also saw the rough spirits of the river march into
      their homes like tyrants returned, as it were, cursing and banging their
      way back to their rightful nests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally he would wish to be in it all again, out in the wild woods
      and on the river and in the shanty, free and strong and friendly and a bit
      ferocious. All he had known of the backwoods life filled his veins,
      tortured him at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day that both wills were made and signed, no word had been spoken
      concerning them between him and John Grier. He admired certain
      characteristics of John Grier; some secret charities, some impulsive
      generosity, some signs of public spirit. The old man was fond of animals,
      and had given water-troughs to the town; and his own horses and the horses
      he used in the woods were always well fed. Also, in all his arrangements
      for the woods, he was generous. He believed in feeding his men well. It
      was rough food&mdash;beans, potatoes, peas, lentils, pork in
      barrels-salted pork; but there was bread of the best, rich soup, pork well
      boiled and fried, with good tea, freshly made. This was the regular fare,
      and men throve on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, shortly after Carnac&rsquo;s return home, there came a change
      in the scene. Things had been going badly for a couple of days and the old
      man had been seriously overworked. He had not listened to the warnings of
      Tarboe, or to the hints thrown out by his own punished physique. He was
      not a man to take hints. Everything that vexed his life roused opposition.
      This Tarboe knew, but he also knew that the business must suffer, if the
      old man suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Grier left the office it was with head bowed and mind depressed.
      Nothing had happened to cause him grave anxiety, yet he had been below par
      for several hours. Why was he working so hard? Why was life to him such a
      concentration? Why did he seek for more money and to get more power? To
      whom could it go? Not to Fabian; not to his wife. To Tarboe&mdash;well,
      there was not enough in that! This man had only lately come into his life,
      and was only near to him in a business sense. Carnac was near in every
      sense that really mattered, and Carnac was out of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not loved, and in his heart of hearts he knew it, but he had had
      his own way, and he loved himself. No one seemed to care for him, not even
      his wife. How many years was it since they had roomed together? Yet as he
      went towards his own home now, he recalled the day they were married, and
      for the first time had drawn as near to each other as life could draw. He
      had thought her wonderful then, refined, and oh! so rich in life&rsquo;s gifts.
      His love had almost throttled her. She was warm and bountiful and full of
      temperament. So it went for three years, and then slowly he drew away from
      her until at last, returning from the backwoods, he had gone to another
      room, and there had stayed. Very occasionally he had smothered her with
      affection, but that had passed, until now, middle-aged, she seemed to be
      not a room away from him, but a thousand rooms away. He saw it with no
      reproach to himself. He forgot it was he who had left her room, and had
      set up his own tabernacle, because his hours differed from hers, and
      because she tossed in her bed at nights, and that made him restless too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, if his love had been the real thing, he would have stayed, because
      their lives were so similar, and the rules of domestic life in French
      Canada were so fixed. He had spoiled his own household, destroyed his own
      peace, forsaken his own nest, outlived his hope and the possibility of
      further hope, except more business success, more to leave behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the stern truth. Had he been a different man the devotion his
      wife had shown would have drawn him back to her; had she been a different
      woman, unvexed by a horrible remembrance, she would have made his soul her
      own and her soul his own once again. She had not dared to tell him the
      truth; afraid more for her boy&rsquo;s sake than for her own. She had been glad
      that Tarboe had helped to replace the broken link with Fabian, that he had
      taken the place which Carnac, had he been John Grier&rsquo;s son, ought to have
      taken. She could not blame Carnac, and she could not blame her husband,
      but the thing ate into her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Grier found her sitting by her table in the great living-room,
      patient and grave, and yet she smiled at him, and rose as he came into the
      room. His troubled face brought her forward quickly. She stretched out a
      hand appealingly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, John? Has anything upset you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not upset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you are,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;but, yes, you are! Something has gone wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong that hasn&rsquo;t been wrong for many a year,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s been wrong for many a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys you brought into this world&mdash;your sons!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Why
      isn&rsquo;t Carnac working with me? There must have been something damned bad in
      the bringing up of those boys. I&rsquo;ve not, got the love of any of you, and I
      know it. Why should I be thrown over by every one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one hasn&rsquo;t thrown you over. Mr. Tarboe hasn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve been in great
      spirits about him. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved a hand savagely at her, with an almost insane look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he to me! He&rsquo;s a man of business. In a business way I like him,
      but I want my own flesh and blood by me in my business. I wanted Carnac,
      and he wouldn&rsquo;t come&mdash;a few weeks only he came. I had Fabian, and he
      wouldn&rsquo;t stay. If I&rsquo;d had a real chance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, with an outward savage protest of his hands, his voice
      falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d had your chance, you&rsquo;d have made your own home happy,&rdquo; she said
      sadly. &ldquo;That was your first duty, not your business&mdash;your home&mdash;your
      home! You didn&rsquo;t care about it. There were times when for months you
      forgot me; and then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a dreadful suspicion seized his brain. His head bent forward, his
      shoulders thrust out, he stumbled towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;well, what then!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Then&mdash;you&mdash;forgot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She realized she had gone too far, saw the storm in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no, I didn&rsquo;t forget you, John. Never&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got no farther. Suddenly his hands stretched out as if to seize her
      shoulders, his face became tortured&mdash;he swayed. She caught him. She
      lowered him to the floor, and put a hassock under his head. Then she rang
      the bell&mdash;rang it&mdash;and rang again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When help came, all was too late. John Grier had gone for ever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. THE READING OF THE WILL
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Tarboe stood in the church alone at the funeral, in a pew behind John
      Grier&rsquo;s family, sadness held him. He had known, as no one else knew, that
      the business would pass into his own hands. He suddenly felt his task too
      big for him, and he looked at Carnac now with sympathy. Carnac had brains,
      capacity, could almost take his father&rsquo;s place; he was tactful, intuitive,
      alert. Yet Carnac, at present, was out of the question. He knew the stress
      of spirit which had turned Carnac from the opportunity lying at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself there ran through his mind another thought. Near by,
      at the left, dressed in mourning also, was Junia. He had made up his mind
      that Junia should be his, and suddenly the usefulness of the business
      about to fall into his hands became a weapon in the field of Love. He was
      physically a finer man than Carnac; he had capacity; he had personality;
      and he would have money and position&mdash;for a time at least. In that
      time, why should he not win this girl with the wonderful eyes and hair,
      with the frankness and candour of unspoiled girlhood in her face?
      Presently he would be in the blare of sensation, in the height of as
      dramatic an episode as comes to the lives of men; and in the episode he
      saw advantages which should weigh with any girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then had come the reading of the will after the funeral rites were over,
      and he, with the family, were gathered in the dining-room of the House on
      the Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was scarcely ready, however, for the prodigious silence following the
      announcement read by the lawyer. He felt as though life was suspended for
      many minutes, when it was proclaimed that he, Luke Tarboe, would inherit
      the property. Although he knew of the contents of the will his heart was
      thumping like a sledge-hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room slowly. The only embarrassment to be seen was on
      the faces of Fabian and his wife. Mrs. Grier and Carnac showed nothing.
      Carnac did not even move; by neither gesture nor motion of body did he
      show aught. At the close of it all, he came to Tarboe and held out a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck to you, Tarboe!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a success, and that&rsquo;s
      what he wanted more than anything else. Good luck to you!&rdquo; he said again
      and turned away....
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Grier&rsquo;s will was published in the Press consternation filled the
      minds of all. Tarboe had been in the business for under two years, yet
      here he was left all the property with uncontracted power. Mrs. John Grier
      was to be paid during her life a yearly stipend of twenty thousand dollars
      from the business; she also received a grant of seventy thousand dollars.
      Beyond that, there were a few gifts to hospitals and for the protection of
      horses, while to the clergyman of the parish went one thousand dollars. It
      certainly could not be called a popular will, and, complimentary as the
      newspapers were to the energy and success of John Grier, few of them
      called him public-spirited, or a generous-hearted citizen. In his death he
      paid the price of his egotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most surprised person, however, was Junia Shale.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her it was shameful that Carnac should be eliminated from all share in
      the abundant fortune John Grier had built up. It seemed fantastic that the
      fortune and the business&mdash;and the business was the fortune&mdash;should
      be left to Tarboe. Had she known the contents of the will before John
      Grier was buried, she would not have gone to the funeral. Egotistic she
      had known Grier to be, and she imagined the will to be a sudden result of
      anger. He was dead and buried. The places that knew him knew him no more.
      All in an hour, as it were, the man Tarboe&mdash;that dominant,
      resourceful figure&mdash;had come into wealth and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Junia read the substance of the will, she went springing up the
      mountain-side, as it were to work off her excitement by fatigue. At the
      mountain-top she gazed over the River St. Lawrence with an eye blind to
      all except this terrible distortion of life. Yet through her obfuscation,
      there ran admiration for Tarboe. What a man he was! He had captured John
      Grier as quickly and as securely as a night fisherman spears a sturgeon in
      the flare at the bow of the boat. Tarboe&rsquo;s ability was as marked as John
      Grier&rsquo;s mad policy. It was strange that Tarboe should have bewildered and
      bamboozled&mdash;if that word could be used&mdash;the old millowner. It
      was as curious and thrilling as John Grier&rsquo;s fanaticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the pinch of corruption had nipped his flesh; he was useless,
      motionless in his narrow house, and yet, unseen but powerful, his
      influence went on. It shamed a wife and son; it blackened the doors of a
      home; it penalized a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed he had been a bad man, and yet she could not reconcile it all with
      a wonderful something in him, a boldness, a sense of humour, an
      everlasting energy, an electric power. She had never seen anyone vitalize
      everything round him as John Grier had done. He threw things from him like
      an exasperated giant; he drew things to him like an Angel of the Covenant.
      To him life was less a problem than an experiment, and this last act, this
      nameless repudiation of the laws of family life, was like the sign of a
      chemist&rsquo;s activity. As she stood on the mountain-top her breath suddenly
      came fast, and she caught her bosom with angry hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carnac&mdash;poor Carnac!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the world say? There were those, perhaps, who thought Carnac
      almost a ne&rsquo;er-do-well, but they were of the commercial world where John
      Grier had been supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, Carnac in the garden of his old home beheld the river
      too and the great expanse of country, saw the grey light of evening on the
      distant hills, and listened to Fabian who condoled with him. When Fabian
      had gone, Carnac sat down on a bench and thought over the whole thing.
      Carnac had no quarrel with his fate. When in the old home on the hill he
      had heard the will, it had surprised him, but it had not shocked him. He
      had looked to be the discarded heir, and he knew it now without rebellion.
      He had never tried to smooth the path to that financial security which his
      father could give. Yet now that disaster had come, there was a glimmer of
      remorse, of revolt, because there was some one besides himself who might
      think he had thrown away his chances. He did not know that over on the
      mountain-side, vituperating the memory of the dead man, Junia was angry
      only for Carnac&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the black storm of sudden death roaring in his ears, he had a sense
      of freedom, almost of licence. Nothing that had been his father&rsquo;s was now
      his own, or his mother&rsquo;s, except the land and house on which they were.
      All the great business John Grier had built up was gone into the hands of
      the usurper, a young, bold, pestilent, powerful, vigorous man. It seemed
      suddenly horrible that the timber-yards and the woods and the offices, and
      the buildings of John Grier&rsquo;s commercial business were not under his own
      direction, or that of his mother, or brother. They had ceased to be
      factors in the equation; they were &lsquo;non est&rsquo; in the postmortem history of
      John Grier. How immense a nerve the old man had to make such a will, which
      outraged every convention of social and family life; which was, in effect,
      a proclamation that his son Carnac had no place in John Grier&rsquo;s scheme of
      things, while John Grier&rsquo;s wife was rewarded like some faithful old
      servant. Yet some newspapers had said he was a man of goodwill, and had
      appreciation of talent, adding, however, the doubtful suggestion that the
      appreciation stopped short of the prowess of his son Carnac in the field
      of Art. It was evident John Grier&rsquo;s act was thought by the conventionalist
      to be a wicked blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Carnac saw the world where there was not a single material thing that
      belonged to him, he had a sudden conviction that his life would run in
      other lines than those within which it had been drawn to the present time.
      Looking over this wonderful prospect of the St. Lawrence, he had an
      insistent feeling that he ought to remain in the land where he was born,
      and give of whatever he was capable to its life. It was all a strenuous
      problem. For Carnac there was, duly or unduly, fairly or unfairly, a fate
      better than that of John Grier. If he died suddenly, as his father had
      died, a handful of people would sorrow with excess of feeling, and the
      growing world of his patrons would lament his loss. No one really grieved
      for John Grier&rsquo;s departure, except&mdash;strange to say&mdash;Tarboe.

      CHAPTER XVIII. A GREAT DECISION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Months went by. In them Destiny made new drawings. With his mother, Carnac
      went to paint at a place called Charlemont. Tarboe pursued his work at the
      mills successfully; Junia saw nothing of Carnac, but she had a letter from
      him, and it might have been written by a man to his friend, yet with an
      undercurrent of sadness that troubled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might, perhaps, have yielded to the attentions of Tarboe, had not an
      appealing message come from her aunt, and at an hour&rsquo;s notice went West
      again on her mission of sick-service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politically the Province of Quebec was in turmoil. The time was drawing
      near when the Dominion Government must go to the polls, and in the most
      secluded cottage on the St. Lawrence, the virtues and defects of the
      administration were vital questions. Voters knew as much of technical
      law-making as the average voter everywhere, but no more, and sometimes
      less. Yet there was in the mind of the French-Canadian an intuition, which
      was as valuable as the deeper knowledge of a trained politician. The two
      great parties in the Province were led by Frenchmen. The English people,
      however, were chiefly identified with the party opposed to Barode
      Barouche, the Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the agitation began in the late spring, Carnac became suddenly
      interested in everything political.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized what John Grier had said concerning politics&mdash;that, given
      other characteristics, the making of laws meant success or failure for
      every profession or trade, for every interest in the country. He had known
      a few politicians; though he had never yet met the most dominant figure in
      the Province&mdash;Barode Barouche, who had a singular fascination for
      him. He seemed a man dominant and plausible, with a right-minded
      impulsiveness. Things John Grier had said about Barouche rang in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the autumn drew near excitement increased. Political meetings were
      being held everywhere. There was one feature more common in Canada than in
      any other country; opposing candidates met on the same platform and fought
      their fight out in the hearing of those whom they were wooing. One day
      Carnac read in a newspaper that Barode Barouche was to speak at St.
      Annabel. As that was not far from Charlemont he determined to hear
      Barouche for the first time. He had for him a sympathy which, to himself,
      seemed a matter of temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go and hear Barode Barouche at
      St. Annabel? You know him&mdash;I mean personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew him long ago,&rdquo; was the scarcely vocal reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great, fine man, isn&rsquo;t he? Wrong-headed, wrong-purposed, but a big
      fine fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man is wrong-headed and wrong-purposed, it isn&rsquo;t easy for him to be
      fine, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends. A man might want to save his country by making some good
      law, and be mistaken both as to the result of that law and the right
      methods in making it. I&rsquo;d like you to be with me when I hear him for the
      first time. I&rsquo;ve got a feeling he&rsquo;s one of the biggest men of our day. Of
      course he isn&rsquo;t perfect. A man might want to save another&rsquo;s life, but he
      might choose the wrong way to do it, and that&rsquo;s wrongheaded; and perhaps
      he oughtn&rsquo;t to save the man&rsquo;s life, and that&rsquo;s wrong-purposed. There&rsquo;s no
      crime in either. Let&rsquo;s go and hear Monsieur Barouche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not see the flush which suddenly filled her face; and, if he had,
      he would not have understood. For her a long twenty-seven years rolled
      back to the day when she was a young neglected wife, full of life&rsquo;s
      vitalities, out on a junction of the river and the wild woods, with Barode
      Barouche&rsquo;s fishing-camp near by. She shivered now as she thought of it. It
      was all so strange, and heart-breaking. For long years she had paid the
      price of her mistake. She knew how eloquent Barode Barouche could be; she
      knew how his voice had all the ravishment of silver bells to the
      unsuspecting. How well she knew him; how deeply she realized the darkness
      of his nature! Once she had said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think that for duty&rsquo;s sake you would cling like a leech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. For thirty long years he had been in one sense homeless, his
      wife having lost her reason three years after they were married. In that
      time he had faithfully visited the place of her confinement every month of
      his life, sobered, chastened, at first hopeful, defiant. At the bottom of
      his heart Barode Barouche did not want marital freedom. He had loved the
      mad woman. He remembered her in the glory of her youth, in the splendour
      of her beauty. The insane asylum did not destroy his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grier remembered too, but in a different way. Her relations with him
      had been one swift, absorbing fever&mdash;a mad dream, a moment of rash
      impulse, a yielding to the natural feeling which her own husband had
      aroused: the husband who now neglected her while Barode Barouche treated
      her so well, until a day when under his beguilement a stormy impulse gave&mdash;Carnac.
      Then the end came, instant and final; she bolted, barred and locked the
      door against Barode and he had made little effort to open it. So they had
      parted, and had never clasped hands or kissed again. To him she was a sin
      of which he never repented. He had watched the growth and development of
      Carnac with a sharp sympathy. He was not a good man; but in him were seeds
      of goodness. To her he was the lash searing her flesh, day in day out,
      year in year out, which kept her sacred to her home. For her children&rsquo;s
      sake she did not tell her husband, and she had emptied out her heart over
      Carnac with overwhelming fondness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go, Carnac,&rdquo; she said at last, for it seemed the easier way. &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t been to a political meeting for many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I like your being with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was held in what had been a skating-rink and drill-hall. On
      the platform in the centre was the chairman, with Barode Barouche on his
      right. There was some preliminary speech-making from the chairman. A
      resolution was moved supporting Barouche, his party and policy, and there
      were little explosions of merriment at strokes of unconscious humour made
      by the speakers; and especially by one old farmer who made his jokes on
      the spot, and who now tried to embalm Barouche with praise. He drew
      attention to Barouche&rsquo;s leonine head and beard, to his alert eyes and
      quizzical face, and said he was as strong in the field of legislation as
      he was in body and mind. Carnac noticed that Barouche listened
      good-naturedly, and now and then cocked his head and looked up at the
      ceiling as though to find something there.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious familiarity in the action of the head which struck
      Carnac. He and his mother were seated about five rows back from the front
      row on the edge of the aisle. As the meeting progressed, Barouche&rsquo;s eyes
      wandered slowly over the faces of his audience. Presently he saw Carnac
      and his mother. Mrs. Grier was conscious of a shock upon the mind of
      Barouche. She saw his eyes go misty with feeling. For him the world was
      suddenly shut out, and he only saw the woods of a late summer&rsquo;s afternoon,
      a lonely tent&mdash;and a woman. A flush crept up his face. Then he made a
      spasmodic gesture of the hand, outward, which again Carnac recognized as
      familiar. It was the kind of thing he did himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed was Barode Barouche that he only mechanically heard the
      chairman announce himself, but when he got to his feet his full senses
      came back. The sight of the woman to whom he had been so much, and who had
      been so much to him for one short month, magnetized him; the face of the
      boy, so like his own as he remembered it thirty years ago, stirred his
      veins. There before him was his own one unacknowledged child&mdash;the
      only child ever born to him. His heart throbbed. Then he began to speak.
      Never in all his life had he spoken as he did this day. It was only a
      rural audience; there was not much intelligence in it; but it had a
      character all its own. It was alive to its own interests, chiefly of
      agriculture and the river. It was composed of both parties, and he could
      stimulate his own side, and, perhaps, win the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that, with the blood pounding through his veins, the inspired
      sensualist began his speech. It was his duty to map out a policy for the
      future; to give the people an idea of what his party meant to do; to
      guide, to inspire, to inflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Carnac listened he kept framing the words not yet issued, but which did
      issue from Barouche&rsquo;s mouth; his quick intelligence correctly imagined the
      line Barouche would take; again and again Barouche made a gesture, or
      tossed his head, or swung upon his feet to right and left in harmony with
      Carnac&rsquo;s own mind. Carnac would say to himself: &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d have
      done&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d have said, if I had his policy.&rdquo; More than
      once, in some inspired moment of the speech, he caught his mother&rsquo;s hand,
      and he did not notice that her hand trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as for one of Barouche&rsquo;s chapter of policy Carnac almost sprang to his
      feet in protest when Barouche declared it. To Carnac it seemed fatal to
      French Canada, though it was expounded with a taking air; yet as he
      himself had said it was &ldquo;wrong-headed and wrong-purposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the speech had finished to great cheering, Carnac suddenly turned to
      his mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the wrong track. I know the policy to down his. He&rsquo;s got no
      opponent. I&rsquo;m going to stand against him at the polls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clutched his arm. &ldquo;Carnac&mdash;Carnac! You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will pretty quick,&rdquo; he replied stoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out after him, if
      they&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. CARNAC BECOMES A CANDIDATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night Carnac mapped out his course, carefully framed the policy to
      offset that of Barode Barouche, and wrote a letter to the Chairman of the
      Opposition at Montreal offering to stand, and putting forward an ingenious
      policy. He asked also for an interview; and the interview was granted by
      telegram&mdash;almost to his surprise. He was aware, however, of the
      discontent among the English members of the Opposition, and of the wish of
      the French members to find a good compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a hope that his singular position&mdash;the notoriety which his
      father&rsquo;s death and his own financial disfranchisement had caused&mdash;would
      be a fine card in his favour. He was not mistaken. His letter arrived at
      Headquarters when there were difficulties concerning three candidates who
      were pressing their claims. Carnac Grier, the disinherited son of the
      great lumber-king, who had fame as an artist, spoke French as though it
      were his native tongue, was an element of sensation which, if adroitly
      used, could be of great service. It might even defeat Barode Barouche. In
      the first place, Carnac was young, good-looking, personable, and taking in
      his manner. Barouche was old, experienced, with hosts of enemies and many
      friends, but with injurious egotism. An interview was, therefore, arranged
      at Headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the day it took place, Carnac&rsquo;s anguished mother went
      with him to the little railway station of Charlemont. She had slept little
      the night before; her mind was in an eddy of emotions. It seemed dreadful
      that Carnac should fight his own father, repeating what Fabian had done in
      another way. Yet at the bottom of her heart there was a secret joy. Some
      native revolt in her had joy in the thought that the son might extort a
      price for her long sorrow and his unknown disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she had listened to Barouche at the meeting, she realized how sincere
      yet insincere he was; how gifted and yet how ungracious was his mind. Her
      youth was over; long pain and regret had chastened her. She was as lonely
      a creature as ever the world knew; violence was no part of her equipment;
      and yet terrible memories made her assent to this new phase of Carnac&rsquo;s
      life. She wondered what Barouche would think. There was some ancient touch
      of war in her which made her rejoice that after long years the hammer
      should strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the thing&rsquo;s tremendous possibilities thrilled her. Carnac had
      always been a politician&mdash;always. She remembered how, when he was a
      boy, he had argued with John Grier on national matters, laid down the law
      with the assurance of an undergraduate, and invented theories impossible
      of public acceptance. Yet in every stand he had taken, there had been
      thought, logic and reasoning, wrongly premised, but always based on
      principles. On paper he was generally right; in practice, generally wrong.
      His buoyant devotion to an idea was an inspiration and a tonic. The
      curious thing was that, while still this political matter was hanging
      fire, he painted with elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother knew he did not see the thousand little things which made
      public life so wearying; that he only realized the big elements of
      national policy. She understood how those big things would inspire the
      artist in him. For, after all, there was the spirit of Art in framing a
      great policy which would benefit millions in the present and countless
      millions in the future. So, at the railway station, as they waited for the
      train, with an agitation outwardly controlled, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men who have fought before, will want to stand, so don&rsquo;t be surprised
      if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they reject me, mother?&rdquo; interrupted Carnac. &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t be
      surprised, but I feel in my bones that I&rsquo;m going to fight Barode Barouche
      into the last corner of the corral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that, my son. Won&rsquo;t the thing that prevents your
      marrying Junia be a danger in this, if you go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sullen tragedy came into his face, his lips set. The sudden paleness of
      his cheek, however, was lost in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought of that; but if it has to come, better it should come
      now than later. If the truth must be told, I&rsquo;ll tell it&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll
      tell it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be bold, but not reckless, Carnac,&rdquo; his mother urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the whistling train approached. She longed to put a hand out and
      hold him back, and yet she ached to let him go. Yet as Carnac mounted the
      steps of the car, a cry went out from her heart: &ldquo;My son, stay with me
      here&mdash;don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo; That was only in her heart, however; with her lips
      she said: &ldquo;Good luck! God bless you, Carnac!&rdquo; and then the train rolled
      away, leaving her alone in the bright, bountiful morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the day was done, Headquarters had accepted Carnac, in part, as the
      solution of their own difficult problem. The three applicants for the post
      each hated the other; but all, before the day was over, agreed to Carnac
      as an effective opponent of Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing seemed clear&mdash;Carnac&rsquo;s policy had elements of seduction
      appealing to the selfishness of all sections, and he had an eloquence
      which would make Barouche uneasy. That eloquence was shown in a speech
      Carnac made in the late evening to the assembled executive. He spoke for
      only a quarter of an hour, but it was long enough to leave upon all who
      heard him an impression of power, pertinacity, picturesqueness and appeal.
      He might make mistakes, but he had qualities which would ride over errors
      with success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not French,&rdquo; he said at last in his speech, &ldquo;but I used to think and
      write in French as though I&rsquo;d been born in Normandy. I&rsquo;m English by birth
      and breeding, but I&rsquo;ve always gone to French schools and to a French
      University, and I know what New France means. I stand to my English
      origin, but I want to see the French develop here as they&rsquo;ve developed in
      France, alive to all new ideas, dreaming good dreams. I believe that
      Frenchmen in Canada can, and should, be an inspiration to the whole
      population. Their great qualities should be the fibre in the body of
      public opinion. I will not pander to the French; I will not be the slave
      of the English; I will be free, and I hope I shall be successful at the
      polls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a small part of the speech which caused much enthusiasm, and was
      the beginning of a movement, powerful, and as time went on, impetuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to bed with the blood of battle throbbing in his veins. In the
      morning he had a reasonable joy in seeing the headlines of his candidature
      in the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was almost appalled, for never since life began had his
      personality been so displayed. It seemed absurd that before he had struck
      a blow he should be advertised like a general in the field. Yet common
      sense told him that in standing against Barouche, he became important in
      the eyes of those affected by Barouche&rsquo;s policy. He had had luck, and it
      was for him to justify that luck. Could he do it? His first thought,
      however, as his eyes fell on the headlines&mdash;he flushed with elation
      so that he scarcely saw&mdash;was for the thing itself. Before him there
      flashed a face, however, which at once sobered his exaltation. It was the
      face of Junia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what she will think,&rdquo; he said to himself, with a little
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew in his heart of hearts she would not think it incongruous that he,
      an artist, should become a politician. Good laws served to make life
      beautiful, good pictures ministered to beauty; good laws helped to tell
      the story of human development; good sculpture strengthened the soul; good
      laws made life&rsquo;s conveniences greater, enlarged activity, lessened the
      friction of things not yet adjusted; good laws taught their framers how to
      balance things, how to make new principles apply without disturbing old
      rights; good pictures increased the well-balanced harmony of the mind of
      the people. Junia would understand these things. As he sat at his
      breakfast, with the newspaper spread against the teapot and the
      milk-pitcher, he felt satisfied he had done the bold and right, if
      incomprehensible, thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in another hotel, at another breakfast, another man read of Carnac&rsquo;s
      candidature with sickening surprise. It was Barode Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after twenty-seven long years, this was to be the issue! His own son,
      whom he had never known, was to fight him at the polls! Somehow, the day
      when he had seen Carnac and his mother at the political meeting had given
      him new emotions. His wife, to whom he had been so faithful in one sense
      since she had passed into the asylum, had died, and with her going, a new
      field of life seemed to open up to him. She had died almost on the same
      day as John Grier. She had been buried secludedly, piteously, and he had
      gone back to his office with the thought that life had become a
      preposterous freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that, on the day when he spoke at the political meeting, his
      life&rsquo;s tragedy became a hammer beating every nerve into emotion. He was
      like one shipwrecked who strikes out with a swimmer&rsquo;s will to reach his
      goal. All at once, on the platform, as he spoke, when his eyes saw the
      faces of Carnac and his mother the catastrophe stunned him like a huge
      engine of war. There had come to him at last a sense of duty where Alma
      Grier was concerned. She was nearly fifty years of age, and he was
      fifty-nine; she was a widow with this world&rsquo;s goods; she had been to him
      how near and dear! for a brief hour, and then&mdash;no more. He knew the
      boy was his son, because he saw his own face, as it had been in his youth,
      though his mother&rsquo;s look was also there-transforming, illumining.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a pang as he saw the two at the close of his meeting filtering out
      into the great retort of the world. Then it was that he had the impulse to
      go to the woman&rsquo;s home, express his sorrow, and in some small sense wipe
      out his wrong by offering her marriage. He had not gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew of Carnac&rsquo;s success in the world of Art; and how he had alienated
      his reputed father by an independence revolting to a slave of convention.
      He had even bought, not from Carnac, but from a dealer, two of Carnac&rsquo;s
      pictures and a statue of a riverman. Somehow the years had had their way
      with him. He had at long last realized that material things were not the
      great things of life, and that imagination, however productive, should be
      guided by uprightness of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was sure, the boy had never been told who his father was. That
      Barouche knew. He had the useful gift of reading the minds of people in
      their faces. From Carnac&rsquo;s face, from Carnac&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s face, had come to
      him the real story. He knew that Alma Grier had sinned only once and with
      him. In the first days after that ill-starred month, he had gone to her,
      only to be repelled as a woman can repel whose soul has been shocked,
      whose self-respect has been shamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been as though she thrust out arms of infinite length to push him
      away, such had been the storm of her remorse, such the revulsion against
      herself and him. So they had fallen apart, and he had seen his boy grow up
      independent, original, wilful, capable&mdash;a genius. He read the
      newspaper reports of what had happened the day before with senses greatly
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, politics was unlike everything else. It was a profession
      recruited from all others. The making of laws was done by all kinds of
      men. One of the wisest advisers in river-law he had ever known was a
      priest; one of the best friends of the legislation of the medical
      profession was a woman; one of the bravest Ministers who had ever
      quarrelled with and conquered his colleagues had been an insurance agent;
      one of the sanest authorities on maritime law had been a man with a
      greater pride in his verses than in his practical capacity; and here was
      Carnac, who had painted pictures and made statues, plunging into politics
      with a policy as ingenious as his own, and as capable of logical
      presentation. This boy, who was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh,
      meant to fight him. He threw back his head and laughed. His boy, his son,
      meant to fight him, did he? Well, so be it! He got to his feet, and walked
      up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, what an issue this!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be terrific, if he won. To
      wipe me out of the life where I have flourished&mdash;what a triumph for
      him! And he would not know how great the triumph would be. She has not
      told him. Yet she will urge him on. Suppose it was she put the idea into
      his head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he threw back his head, shaking the long brown hair, browner than
      Carnac&rsquo;s, from his forehead. &ldquo;Suppose she did this thing&mdash;she who was
      all mine for one brief moment! Suppose she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every nerve tingled; every drop of blood beat hard against his walls of
      flesh; his every vicious element sprang into life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no&mdash;but no, she would not do it. She would not teach her son to
      destroy his own father. But something must have told him to come and
      listen to me, to challenge me in his own mind, and then&mdash;then this
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the paper, leaning over the table, as though it were a
      document of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go on: I must uphold the policy for which I&rsquo;ve got the assent of
      the Government.&rdquo; Suddenly his hands clenched. &ldquo;I will beat him. He shall
      not bring me to the dust. I gave him life, and he shall not take my life
      from me. He&rsquo;s at the beginning; I&rsquo;m going towards the end. I wronged his
      mother&mdash;yes, I wronged him too! I wronged them both, but he does not
      know he&rsquo;s wronged. He&rsquo;ll live his own life; he has lived it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came a tap at the door. Presently it opened and a servant came in.
      He had in his hand a half-dozen telegrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All about the man that&rsquo;s going to fight you, I expect, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the
      servant as he handed the telegrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barode Barouche did not reply, but nodded a little scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman has called,&rdquo; continued the servant. &ldquo;She wants to see you,
      m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s very important, she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barouche shook his head in negation. &ldquo;No, Gaspard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t one of the usual kind, I think, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; protested Gaspard.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the election. It&rsquo;s got something to do with that&mdash;&rdquo; he
      pointed to the newspaper propped against the teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that, is it? Well, what about that?&rdquo; He eyed the servant as
      though to see whether the woman had given any information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She didn&rsquo;t tell me. She&rsquo;s got a mind of her own. She&rsquo;s even
      handsome, and she&rsquo;s well-dressed. All she said was: &lsquo;Tell m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; I want
      to see him. It&rsquo;s about the election-about Mr. Grier.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barode Barouche&rsquo;s heart stopped. Something about Carnac Grier&mdash;something
      about the election&mdash;and a woman! He kept a hand on himself. It must
      not be seen that he was in any way moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s French, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I ought to see her, Gaspard?&rdquo; said Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the confident reply. &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s out against whoever&rsquo;s
      against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw her before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t finished my breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s anything important that&rsquo;ll help you, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s like
      whittling. If you can do things with your hands while you&rsquo;re talking and
      thinking, it&rsquo;s a great help. You go on eating. I&rsquo;ll show her up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barouche smiled maliciously. &ldquo;Well, show her up, Gaspard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll show herself up after I show her in,&rdquo;
       he said, and he went out hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door opened again, and Gaspard stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady to see you, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barouche rose from the table, but he did not hold out his hand. The woman
      was young, good looking, she seemed intelligent. There was also a latent
      cruelty in her face which only a student of human nature could have seen
      quickly. She was a woman with a grievance&mdash;that was sure. He knew the
      passionate excitement, fairly well controlled; he saw her bitterness at a
      glance. He motioned her to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an early call,&rdquo; he said with a smile. Smiling was one of his
      serviceable assets; it was said no man could so palaver the public with
      his cheerful goodnature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s an early call,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I wish not to wait till you
      go to your office. I wanted you to know something. It has to do with Mr.
      Carnac Grier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&mdash;eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve got to know. If I give you the sure means to win
      your election, it would be worth while&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beating of Barouche&rsquo;s heart was hard, but nothing showed in his face.
      There he had control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like people who know their own minds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe
      anything till I study what I hear. Is it something to injure Mr. Grier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a married man went about as a single man and stood up for Parliament
      against you, don&rsquo;t you think you could spoil him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Barouche was silent. Here was an impeachment of his own son,
      but this son was out to bring his own father to the ground. There were two
      ways to look at it. There was the son&rsquo;s point of view, and there was his
      own. If he loved his son he ought to know the thing that threatened him;
      if he hated his son he ought to know. So, after a moment&rsquo;s study of the
      face with the fiery eyes and a complexion like roses touched with frost,
      he said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have I the honour of addressing Carnac Grier&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barouche had had many rewards in his life, but the sweetest reward of all
      was now his own. As events proved, he had taken a course which, if he
      cared for his son, was for that son&rsquo;s well-being, and if he cared for
      himself most, was essential to his own well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relief crossed the woman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Luzanne told her story, avoiding the fact that Carnac had been
      tricked into the marriage. At last she said: &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve come here to make
      him acknowledge me. He&rsquo;s ruined my life, broken my hopes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken your hopes!&rdquo; interrupted Barode Barouche. &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have married some one else. I could have married some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you? There&rsquo;s the Divorce Court. What&rsquo;s to prevent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me that&mdash;you a Frenchman and a Roman Catholic! I&rsquo;m French. I
      was born in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you let me see your papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you want to see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day-if possible to-day,&rdquo; he answered. Then he held her eyes. &ldquo;To whom
      else here have you told this story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one&mdash;no one. I only came last night, and when I took up the paper
      this morning, I saw. Then I found out where you lived, and here I am, bien
      sur. I&rsquo;m here under my maiden name, Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle Luzanne Larue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s right. Now, until we meet again, don&rsquo;t speak of this
      to anyone. Will you give me your word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; she said, and there was revenge and passion in her eyes.
      Suddenly a strange expression crept over her face. She was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something of him about you,&rdquo; she said, and her forehead gathered.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some look! Well, there it is, but it&rsquo;s something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she was gone. As the door closed, he stretched his hands
      above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nom de Dieu, what a situation!&rdquo; he remarked.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. JUNIA AND TARBOE HEAR THE NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      To most people Carnac&rsquo;s candidature was a surprise; to some it was a
      bewilderment, and to one or two it was a shock. To the second class
      belonged Fabian Grier and his wife; to the third class belonged Luke
      Tarboe. Only one person seemed to understand it&mdash;by intuition: Junia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, nothing Carnac did changed Junia&rsquo;s views of him, or surprised
      her, though he made her indignant often enough. To her mind, however, in
      the big things, his actions always had reasonableness. She had never felt
      his artist-life was to be the only note of his career. When, therefore, in
      the West she read a telegram in a newspaper announcing his candidature,
      she guessed the suddenness of his decision. When she read it, she spread
      the paper on the table, smoothed it as though it were a beautiful piece of
      linen, then she stretched out her hands in happy benediction. Like most of
      her sex, she loved the thrill of warfare. There flashed the feeling,
      however, that it would be finer sport if Carnac and Tarboe were to be at
      war, instead of Carnac and Barouche. It was curious she never thought of
      Carnac but the other man came throbbing into sight&mdash;the millionaire,
      for he was that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one way, this last move of Carnac&rsquo;s had the elements of a
      master-stroke. She knew how strange it would seem to the rest of the
      world, yet it did not seem strange to her. No man she had ever seen had
      been so at home in the world of men, and also at home in the secluded
      field of the chisel and the brush as Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the newspaper over to her aunt, holding it up. The big headlines
      showed like semaphores on the page. As the graceful figure of Junia drew
      to her aunt&mdash;her slim feet, in the brown, well-polished boots, the
      long, full neck, and then the chin, Grecian, shapely and firm, the
      straight, sensitive nose, the wonderful eyes under the well-cut, broad
      forehead, with the brown hair, covering it like a canopy&mdash;the old
      lady reached out and wound her arms round the lissome figure. Situated so,
      she read the telegram, and then the old arms gripped her tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, the whistle of a train sounded. The aunt stretched out an
      approving finger to the sound. She realized that the figure round which
      her arms hung trembled, for it was the &ldquo;through&rdquo; daily train for Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back at once, aunty,&rdquo; Junia said.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       ..........................
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m jiggered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were Tarboe&rsquo;s words when Carnac&rsquo;s candidature came first to him in
      the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s &lsquo;broke&rsquo; out in a new place,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe loved the spectacular, and this was indeed spectacular. Yet he had
      not the mental vision of Junia who saw how close, in one intimate sense,
      was the relation between the artist life and the political life. To him it
      was a gigantic break from a green pasture into a red field of war. To her,
      it was a resolution which, in anyone else&rsquo;s life, would have seemed
      abnormal; in Carnac&rsquo;s life it had naturalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe had been for a few months only the reputed owner of the great
      business, and he had paid a big price for his headship in the weighty
      responsibility, the strain of control; but it had got into his blood, and
      he felt life would not be easy without it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there was Junia. To him she was the one being in the world worth
      struggling for; the bird to be caught on the wing, or coaxed into the
      nest, or snared into the net; and two of the three things he had tried
      without avail. The third&mdash;the snaring? He would not stop at that, if
      it would bring him what he wanted. How to snare her! He surveyed himself
      in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great hulking figure like that!&rdquo; he said in disapproval. &ldquo;All bone and
      muscle and flesh and physical show! It wouldn&rsquo;t weigh with her. She&rsquo;s too
      fine. It isn&rsquo;t the animal in a man she likes. It&rsquo;s what he can do, and
      what he is, and where he&rsquo;s going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of Carnac&rsquo;s new outburst, and his veins ran cold. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
      like that&mdash;but yes, she&rsquo;ll like that: and if he succeeds she&rsquo;ll think
      he&rsquo;s great. Well, she&rsquo;d be right. He&rsquo;ll beat Barouche. He&rsquo;s young and
      brave, careless and daring. Now where am I in this fight? I belong to
      Barouche&rsquo;s party and my vote ought to go for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes he sat in profound thought. What part should he play? He
      liked Carnac, he owed him a debt which he could never repay. Carnac had
      saved him from killing Denzil. If that had happened, he himself might have
      gone to the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided. Sitting down, he wrote Carnac the following letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DEAR CARNAC GRIER,

   I see you&rsquo;re beginning a new work. You now belong to a party that I
   am opposed to, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me offering you support. It&rsquo;s
   not your general policy, but it is you, the son of your father, that
   I mean to work for. If you want financial help for your campaign&mdash;
   or after it is over&mdash;come and get it here&mdash;ten thousand or more if
   you wish. Your father, if he knew&mdash;and perhaps he does know&mdash;would
   be pleased that you, who could not be a man of business in his
   world, are become a man of business in the bigger world of law-
   making. You may be right or wrong in that policy, but that don&rsquo;t
   weigh with me. You&rsquo;ve taken on as big a job as ever your father
   did. What&rsquo;s the use of working if you don&rsquo;t try to do the big thing
   that means a lot to people outside yourself! If you make new good
   laws, if you do something for the world that&rsquo;s wonderful, it&rsquo;s as
   much as your father did, or, if he was alive, could do now.
   Whatever there is here is yours to use. When you come back here to
   play your part, you&rsquo;ll make it a success&mdash;the whole blessed thing.
   I don&rsquo;t wish you were here now, except that it&rsquo;s yours&mdash;all of it&mdash;
   but I wish you to beat Barode Barouche.

                  Yours to the knife,

                         LUKE TARBOE.
</pre>
    <p>
      He read the letter through, and coming to the words, &ldquo;When you come back
      here to play your part, you&rsquo;ll make it a success&mdash;the whole blessed
      thing,&rdquo; he paused, reflecting... He wondered what Carnac would think the
      words meant, and he felt it was bold, and, maybe, dangerous play; but it
      was not more dangerous than facts he had dealt with often in the last two
      years. He would let it stand, that phrase of the hidden meaning. He did
      not post the letter yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later he put on his wide-brimmed panama hat and went out into
      the street leading to the centre of the city. There was trouble in the
      river reaches between his men and those of Belloc-Grier, and he was
      keeping an appointment with Belloc at Fabian Grier&rsquo;s office, where several
      such meetings had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone far, however, when he saw a sprightly figure in
      light-brown linen cutting into his street from a cross-road. He had not
      seen that figure for months-scarcely since John Grier&rsquo;s death, and his
      heart thumped in his breast. It was Junia. How would she greet him?
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he met her. Raising his hat, he said: &ldquo;Back to the
      firing-line, Miss Shale! It&rsquo;ll make a big difference to every one
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you then concerned?&rdquo; she asked, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the most concerned,&rdquo; he answered with a smile not so composed as
      her own. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the honour of the name that&rsquo;s at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to ruin Mr. Grier&rsquo;s chances in the fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I said, &lsquo;the honour of the name,&rsquo; and the name of my
      firm is &lsquo;Grier&rsquo;s Company of Lumbermen.&rsquo; So I&rsquo;m in it with all my might,
      and here&rsquo;s a letter&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t posted it yet&mdash;saying to Carnac
      Grier where I stand. Will you read it? There&rsquo;s no reason why you
      shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He tore open the envelope and took the letter out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia took it, after hesitation, and read it till she came to the sentence
      about Carnac returning to the business. She looked up, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to the elusive sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might want to come into the business some day, and I&rsquo;ll give him his
      chance. Nothing more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more than that!&rdquo; she said cynically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bravely said, but how
      can he be a partner if he can&rsquo;t buy the shares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter to be thought out,&rdquo; he answered with a queer twist to his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve offered to help him with cash for the election,&rdquo; she said,
      handing back the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt it had to be done. Politics are expensive they sap the purse.
      That&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never thought of giving him an income which would compensate a little
      for what his father failed to do for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was asperity in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t take from me what his father didn&rsquo;t give him.&rdquo; Suddenly an
      idea seized him. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a friend of the Griers, why
      don&rsquo;t you help keep things straight between the two concerns? You could do
      it. You have the art of getting your own way. I&rsquo;ve noticed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;d like me to persuade Fabian Grier to influence Belloc, because
      I&rsquo;d make things easy for you!&rdquo; she said briskly. &ldquo;Do you forget I&rsquo;ve known
      Fabian since I was a baby, that my sister is his wife, and that his
      interests are near to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not knuckle down. &ldquo;I think it would be helping Fabian&rsquo;s interests.
      Belloc and Fabian Grier are generally in the wrong, and to keep them right
      would be good business-policy. When I&rsquo;ve trouble with Belloc&rsquo;s firm it&rsquo;s
      because they act like dogs in the manger. They seem to hate me to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed&mdash;a buoyant, scornful laugh. &ldquo;So all the fault is in
      Belloc and Fabian, is it?&rdquo; She was impressed enormously by his sangfroid
      and will to rule the roost. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re clever, and that you&rsquo;ve got
      plenty of horse-sense, as they say in the West, but you&rsquo;ll be beaten in
      the end. How does it feel&rdquo;&mdash;she asked it with provoking candour&mdash;&ldquo;to
      be the boss of big things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m always settling troubles my business foes make for me. I have
      to settle one of them now, and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve met you, for you can help me.
      I want some new river-rules made. If Belloc and Grier&rsquo;ll agree to them,
      we&rsquo;ll do away with this constant trouble between our gangs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d like me to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled a big riverman&rsquo;s smile down at her, full of good-humour and
      audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could make it clear to Fabian that all I&rsquo;m after is peace on the
      river, it&rsquo;d do a lot of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you know,&rdquo; she said demurely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll take a hand in
      this game, chiefly because&mdash;&rdquo; she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: chiefly because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ll get your own way without help. You get everything you
      want,&rdquo; she added with a little savage comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flood of feeling came into his eyes, his head jerked like that of a
      bull-moose. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t get everything I want. The thing I want most in
      the world doesn&rsquo;t come to me.&rdquo; His voice grew emotional. She knew what he
      was trying to say, and as the idea was not new she kept composure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not as lucky as you think me,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty lucky. You&rsquo;ve done it all as easy as clasping your fingers.
      If I had your luck&mdash;!&rdquo; she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, but if I could reach out and touch you at any
      time, as it were, I think it&rsquo;d bring me permanent good luck. You&rsquo;ll find
      out one day that my luck is only a bubble the prick of a pin&rsquo;ll destroy. I
      don&rsquo;t misunderstand it. I&rsquo;ve been left John Grier&rsquo;s business by Grier
      himself, and he&rsquo;s got a son that ought to have it, and maybe will have it,
      when the time is ripe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly an angry hand flashed out towards him. &ldquo;When the time is ripe!
      Does that mean, when you&rsquo;ve made all you want, you&rsquo;ll give up to Carnac
      what isn&rsquo;t yours but his? Why don&rsquo;t you do it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because, in the first place, I like my job and he doesn&rsquo;t want it;
      in the second place, I promised his father I&rsquo;d run the business as he
      wished it run; and in the third place, Carnac wouldn&rsquo;t know how to use the
      income the business brings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed in a mocking, challenging way. &ldquo;Was there ever a man didn&rsquo;t
      know how to use an income no matter how big it was! You&rsquo;re talking
      enigmas, and I think we&rsquo;d better say good-bye. Your way to the Belloc
      offices is down that street.&rdquo; She pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t help me? You won&rsquo;t say a word to Fabian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged a shoulder. &ldquo;If I were a man like you, who&rsquo;s so big, so
      lucky, and so dominant, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask a woman to help me. I&rsquo;d do the job
      myself. I&rsquo;d keep faith with my reputation. But there&rsquo;s one nice thing
      about you: you&rsquo;re going to help Carnac to beat Barode Barouche. You&rsquo;ve
      made a gallant offer. If you&rsquo;d gone against him, if you&rsquo;d played
      Barouche&rsquo;s game, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The indignation which came to her face suddenly fled, and she said:
      &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;d never speak to you again, and I always keep my word.
      Carnac&rsquo;ll see it through. He&rsquo;s a man of mark, Mr. Tarboe, and he&rsquo;ll be
      Prime Minister of the whole country one day. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll like
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hit hard, but if I hadn&rsquo;t taken the business, Carnac Grier wouldn&rsquo;t
      have got it. If it hadn&rsquo;t been me, it would have been some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you live like a rich man and not like a foreman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been too busy to change my mode of living. I only want enough to eat
      and drink and wear, and that&rsquo;s not costly.&rdquo; Suddenly an idea came to him.
      &ldquo;Now, if that business had been left to you, you&rsquo;d be building a stone
      house somewhere; and you&rsquo;d have horses and carriages, and lots of
      servants, and you&rsquo;d swing along like a pretty coloured bird in the
      springtime, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had wealth, I&rsquo;d make it my servant. I&rsquo;d give it its chance; but as I
      haven&rsquo;t got it, I live as I do&mdash;poor and unknown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unknown. See, you could control what belonged to John Grier, if you
      would. I need some one to show me how to spend the money coming from the
      business. What is wealth unless you buy things that give pleasure to life?
      Do you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got no further. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything you&rsquo;re trying to tell me, and
      anyhow this is not the place&mdash;&rdquo; With that she hastened from him up
      the street. Tarboe had a pang, and yet her very last words gave him hope.
      &ldquo;I may be a bit sharp in business,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but I certainly
      am a fool in matters of the heart. Yet what she said at last had something
      in it for me. Every woman has an idea where a man ought to make love to
      her, and this open road certainly ain&rsquo;t the place. If Carnac wins this
      game with Barouche I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll be with her-maybe I&rsquo;m a fool to
      help him.&rdquo; He turned the letter over and over in his hand. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. I
      ought to do it, and I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he fell to brooding. He remembered about the second hidden will.
      There came upon him a wild wish to destroy it. He loved controlling John
      Grier&rsquo;s business. Never had anything absorbed him so. Life seemed a new
      thing. The idea of disappearing from the place where, with a stroke of his
      fingers, he moved five thousand men, or swept a forest into the great
      river, or touched a bell which set going a saw-mill with its many
      cross-cut saws, or filled a ship to take the pine, cedar, maple, ash or
      elm boards to Europe, or to the United States, was terrible to him. He
      loved the smell of the fresh-cut wood. The odour of the sawdust as he
      passed through a mill was sweeter than a million bunches of violets. Many
      a time he had caught up a handful of the damp dust and smelt it, as an
      expert gardener would crumble the fallen flowers of a fruit tree and sniff
      the sweet perfume. To be master of one of the greatest enterprises of the
      New World for three years, and then to disappear! He felt he could not do
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His feelings shook his big frame. The love of a woman troubled his spirit.
      Suppose the will were declared and the girl was still free, what would she
      do?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he set foot in the office of the firm of Belloc, however, he steeled
      himself to composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His task well accomplished, he went back to his own office, and spent the
      day like a racehorse under the lash, restive, defiant, and reckless. When
      night and the shadows came, he sat alone in his office with drawn blinds,
      brooding, wondering.

      CHAPTER XXI. THE SECRET MEETING
    </h2>
    <p>
      As election affairs progressed, Mrs. Grier kept withdrawn from public
      ways. She did not seek supporters for her son. As the weeks went on, the
      strain became intense. Her eyes were aflame with excitement, but she grew
      thinner, until at last she was like a ghost haunting familiar scenes.
      Once, and once only, did she have touch with Barode Barouche since the
      agitation began. This was how it happened:
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was at Ottawa, and she was alone, in the late evening. As she sat
      sewing, she heard a knock at the front door. Her heart stood still. It was
      a knock she had not heard for over a quarter of a century, but it had an
      unforgettable touch. She waited a moment, her face pale, her eyes shining
      with tortured memory. She waited for the servant to answer the knock, but
      presently she realized that the servant probably had not heard. Laying
      down her work, she passed into the front hall. There for an instant she
      paused, then opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Barode Barouche. Then the memory of a summer like a terrible dream
      shook her. She trembled. Some old quiver of the dead days swept through
      her. How distant and how&mdash;bad it all was! For one instant the old
      thrill repeated itself and then was gone&mdash;for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you wish here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not shut the door?&rdquo; he responded, for her fingers were on the
      handle. &ldquo;I cannot speak with the night looking in. Won&rsquo;t you ask me to
      your sitting-room? I&rsquo;m not a robber or a rogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she closed the door. Then she turned, and, in the dim light, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are both a robber and a rogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer until they had entered the sittin-groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you that which is out against me now. Is he not brilliant, capable
      and courageous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in her face a stern duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Fate, monsieur. When he and I went to your political meeting at
      Charlemont it had no purpose. No blush came to his cheek, because he did
      not know who his father is. No one in the world knows&mdash;no one except
      myself, that must suffer to the end. Your speech roused in him the native
      public sense, the ancient fire of the people from whom he did not know he
      came. His origin has been his bane from the start. He did not know why the
      man he thought his father seemed almost a stranger to him. He did not
      understand, and so they fell apart. Yet John Grier would have given more
      than he had to win the boy to himself. Do you ever think what the boy must
      have suffered? He does not know. Only you and I know!&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust out a hand as though to stay her speech, but she went on again
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away from me. You have spoiled my life; you have spoiled my boy&rsquo;s
      life, and now he fights you. I give him no help save in one direction. I
      give to him something his reputed father withheld from him. Don&rsquo;t you
      think it a strange thing&rdquo;&mdash;her voice was thick with feeling&mdash;&ldquo;that
      he never could bear to take money from John Grier, and that, even as a
      child, gifts seemed to trouble him. I think he wanted to give back again
      all that John Grier had ever paid out to him or for him; and now, at last,
      he fights the man who gave him birth! I wanted to tell John Grier all, but
      I did not because I knew it would spoil his life and my boy&rsquo;s life. It was
      nothing to me whether I lived or died. But I could not bear Carnac should
      know. He was too noble to have his life spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barode Barouche drew himself together. Here was a deep, significant
      problem, a situation that needed more expert handling than he had ever
      shown. As he stood by the table, the dim light throwing haggard
      reflections on her face, he had a feeling that she was more than normal.
      He saw her greater than he had ever imagined her. Something in him
      revolted at a war between his own son and himself. Also, he wanted to tell
      her of the danger in which Carnac was&mdash;how Luzanne had come, and was
      hidden away in the outskirts of the city, waiting for the moment when the
      man who rejected her should be sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Barouche was face to face with Alma Grier, however, he felt the
      appalling nature of his task. In all the years he had taken no chance to
      pay tribute to the woman who, in a real sense, had been his mistress of
      body and mind for one short term of life, and who once, and once only, had
      yielded to him. They were both advanced in years, and Life and Time had
      taken toll. She was haggard, yet beautiful in a wan way. He did not
      believe the vanished years had placed between them an impassable barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his chances to the test at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;I understand. You remained silent because your nature
      was too generous to injure anyone. Down at the bottom of his heart,
      cantankerous, tyrannical as he was, John Grier loved you, and I loved you
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a protest of her hand. &ldquo;Oh, no! You never knew what love was&mdash;never!
      You had passion, you had hunger of the body, but of love you did not know.
      I know you, Barode Barouche. You have no heart, you have only sentiment
      and imagination. No&mdash;no, you could not be true. You could never know
      how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a tempest of fire seemed to burn in his eyes, in his whole being.
      His face flushed: his eyes gleamed; his hands were thrust out with
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not understand that were I as foul as hell, a woman like you
      would make me clean again? The wild sin of our youth has eaten into the
      soul of my life. You think I have been indifferent to you and to our boy.
      No, never-never! That I left you both to yourselves was the best proof I
      was not neglectful. I was sorry, with all my soul, that you should have
      suffered through me. In the first reaction, I felt that nothing could put
      me right with you or with eternal justice. So I shrank away from you. You
      thought it was lust satisfied. I tell you it was honour shamed. Good God!
      You thought me just the brazen roue, who seized what came his way, who ate
      the fruit within his grasp, who lived to deceive for his own selfish joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think that? Then, if you did, I do not wonder you should be glad
      to see my son fighting me. It would seem the horrible revenge Destiny
      should take.&rdquo; He took a step nearer to her. His face flamed, his arms
      stretched out. &ldquo;I have held you in these arms. I come with repentance in
      my heart, with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face now was flushed. She interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in you, Barode Barouche. At least my husband did not go
      from his hearthstone looking for what belonged to others. No&mdash;No&mdash;no;
      however much I suffered, I understood that what he did not feel for me at
      least he felt for no one else. To him, life was his business, and to the
      long end business mastered his emotions. I have no faith in you! In the
      depth of my soul something cries out: &lsquo;He is not true. His life is false.&rsquo; 
      To leave me that was right, but, monsieur, not as you left me. You pick
      the fruit and eat it and spit upon the ground the fibre and the skin. I am
      no longer the slave of your false eloquence. It has nothing in it for me
      now, nothing at all&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet your son&mdash;has he naught of me? If your son has genius, I have
      the right to say a part of it came from me. Why should you say that all
      that&rsquo;s good in the boy is yours&mdash;that the boy, in all he does and
      says, is yours! No&mdash;no. Your long years of suffering have hardened
      into injustice and wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he touched her arm. &ldquo;There are women as young as you were when I
      wronged you, who would be my wife now&mdash;young, beautiful, buoyant; but
      I come to you because I feel we might still have some years of happiness.
      Together, where our boy&rsquo;s fate mattered, we two could help him on his way.
      That is what I feel, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he touched her arm she did not move, yet there was in his fingers
      something which stirred ulcers long since healed and scarred. She stepped
      back from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not touch me. The past is buried for ever. There can be no
      resurrection. I know what I should do, and I will do it. For the rest of
      my life, I shall live for my son. I hope he will defeat you. I don&rsquo;t lift
      a hand to help him except to give him money, not John Grier&rsquo;s money but my
      own, always that. You are fighting what is stronger than yourself. One
      thing is sure, he is nearer to the spirit of your race than you. He will
      win&mdash;but yes, he will win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face suffused with warmth, became alive with a wonderful fire, her
      whole being had a simple tragedy. Once again, and perhaps for the last
      time, she had renewed the splendour of her young womanhood. The vital
      warmth of a great idea had given an expression to her face which had long
      been absent from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back from her. Then suddenly passion seized him. The gaunt beauty
      of her roused a spirit of contest in him. The evil thing in him, which her
      love for her son had almost conquered, came back upon him. He remembered
      Luzanne, and now with a spirit alive with anger he said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no, he cannot win.&rdquo; He stretched out a hand. &ldquo;I have
      that which will keep for me the place in Parliament that has been mine;
      which will send him back to the isolation whence he came. Do you think I
      don&rsquo;t know how to win an election? Why from east to west, from north to
      south in this Province of Quebec my name, my fame, have been
      all-conquering. Suppose he did defeat me, do you think that would end my
      political life? It would end nothing. I should still go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A scornful smile came to her lips. &ldquo;So you think your party would find a
      seat for you who had been defeated by a young man who never knew what
      political life meant till he came to this campaign? You think they would
      find you a seat? I know you are coming to the end of your game, and when
      he defeats you, it will finish everything for you. You will disappear from
      public life, and your day will be done. Men will point at you as you pass
      along the street, and say: &lsquo;There goes Barode Barouche. He was a great man
      in his day. He was defeated by a boy with a painter&rsquo;s brush in his hand.&rsquo; 
      He will take from you your livelihood. You will go, and he will stay; he
      will conquer and grow strong. Go from me, Barode Barouche,&rdquo; she cried,
      thrusting out her hands against him, &ldquo;go from me. I love my son with all
      my soul. His father has no place in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been upon him the wild passion of revenge. It had mastered him
      before she spoke, and while she spoke, but, as she finished, the
      understanding spirit of him conquered. Instead of telling her of Luzanne
      Larue, and of what he would do if he found things going against him,
      instead of that he resolved to say naught. He saw he could not conquer
      her. For a minute after she had ceased speaking, he watched her in
      silence, and in his eyes was a remorse which would never leave them. She
      was master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, and with a sense of defeat, he said to her: &ldquo;Well, we shall never
      meet again like this. The fight goes on. I will defeat Carnac. No, do not
      shake your head. He shall not put me from my place. For you and me there
      is no future&mdash;none; yet I want to say to you before we part for ever
      now, that you have been deeper in my life than any other woman since I was
      born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more. Catching up his hat from the chair, and taking his stick,
      he left the room. He opened the front door, stepped out, shut it behind
      him and, in a moment, was lost in the night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. POINT TO POINT
    </h2>
    <p>
      While these things were happening, Carnac was spending all his time in the
      constituency. Every day was busy to the last minute, every hole in the
      belt of his equipment was buckled tight. In spite of his enthusiasm he
      was, however, troubled by the fact that Luzanne might appear. Yet as time
      went on he gained confidence. There were days, however, when he appeared,
      mentally, to be watching the street corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at a public meeting he thought the sensation had come. He had just
      finished his speech in reply to Barode Barouche&mdash;eloquent, eager,
      masterful. Youth&rsquo;s aspirations, with a curious sympathy with the French
      Canadian people, had idealized his utterances. When he finished there had
      been cheering, but in the quiet instant that followed the cheering, a
      habitant got up&mdash;a weird, wilful fellow who had a reputation for
      brag, yet who would not have hurt an enemy save in wild passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac Grier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to put a question to you.
      You&rsquo;ve been asking for our votes. We&rsquo;re a family people, we Canucs, and we
      like to know where we&rsquo;re going. Tell me, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, where&rsquo;s your woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having asked the question, he remained standing. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your woman?&rdquo; the
      habitant had asked. Carnac&rsquo;s breath came quick and sharp. There were many
      hundreds present, and a good number of them were foes. Barode Barouche was
      on the same platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only Carnac was stirred by the question, for Barouche, who had
      listened to his foe&rsquo;s speech with admiring anxiety, was startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your woman?&rdquo; was not a phrase to be asked anyhow, or anywhere.
      Barouche was glad of the incident. Ready as he was to meet challenge, he
      presently realized that his son had a readiness equally potent. He was
      even pleased to see the glint of a smile at the lips of the slim young
      politician, in whom there was more than his own commingling of
      temperament, wisdom, wantonness and raillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment, Carnac said: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a leading question to an
      unmarried man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barouche laughed inwardly. Surely it was the reply he himself would have
      made. Carnac had showed himself a born politician. The audience cheered,
      but the questioner remained standing. He meant to ask another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down&mdash;sit down, jackass!&rdquo; shouted some of the more raucous of
      the crowd, but the man was stubborn. He stretched out an arm towards
      Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, look here, my son, you take my advice. Pursue the primrose path
      into the meadows of matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Carnac shrank, but his mind rallied courageously, and he said:
      &ldquo;There are other people who want to ask questions, perhaps.&rdquo; He turned to
      Barode Barouche. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suggest my opponent has planned this heckling,
      but he can see it does no good. I&rsquo;m not to be floored by catch-penny
      tricks. I&rsquo;m going to win. I run straight. I haven&rsquo;t been long enough in
      politics to learn how to deceive. Let the accomplished professionals do
      that. They know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved a hand disdainfully at Barouche. &ldquo;Let them put forth all that&rsquo;s
      in them, I will remain; let them exert the last ounce of energy, I will
      prevail; let them use the thousand devices of elections, I will use no
      device, but rely upon my policy. I want nothing except my chance in
      Parliament. My highest ambition is to make good laws. I am for the man who
      was the first settler on the St. Lawrence and this section of the
      continent&mdash;his history, his tradition, his honour and fame are in the
      history books of the world. If I should live a hundred years, I should
      wish nothing better than the honour of having served the men whose
      forefathers served Frontenac, Cartier, La Salle and Maisonneuve, and all
      the splendid heroes of that ancient age. What they have done is for all
      men to do. They have kept the faith. I am for the habitant, for the land
      of his faith and love, first and last and all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in a tumult of cheering. Many present remarked that no two men
      they had ever heard spoke so much alike, and kept their attacks so free
      from personal things.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been at this public meeting two intense supporters of Carnac,
      who waited for him at the exit from the main doorway. They were Fabian&rsquo;s
      wife and Junia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barode Barouche came out of the hall before Carnac. His quick eye saw the
      two ladies, and he raised his broad-brimmed hat like a Stuart cavalier,
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for your champion, eh?&rdquo; he asked with cynical friendliness.
      &ldquo;Well, work hard, because that will soften his fall.&rdquo; He leaned over, as
      it were confidentially, to them, while his friends craned their necks to
      hear what he said: &ldquo;If I were you I&rsquo;d prepare him. He&rsquo;s beaten as sure as
      the sun shines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junia was tempted to say what was in her mind, but her sister Sibyl, who
      resented Barouche&rsquo;s patronage, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old adage about the slip &lsquo;twixt the cup and the lip, Monsieur
      Barouche. He&rsquo;s young, and he&rsquo;s got a better policy than yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s unmarried, eh!&rdquo; Barouche remarked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s unmarried, and I
      suppose that matters!&rdquo; There was an undercurrent of meaning in his voice
      which did not escape Junia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Monsieur Barouche is also unmarried,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re even
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite even. I&rsquo;m a widower. The women don&rsquo;t work for me as they work
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; remarked Junia. &ldquo;The women can&rsquo;t all marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a lot of things that can&rsquo;t be understood by just blinking the
      eyes, but there&rsquo;s romance in the fight of an unmarried man, and women like
      romance even if it&rsquo;s some one else&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s sensation in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barouche looked to where Carnac was slowly coming down the centre of the
      hall. Women were waving handkerchiefs and throwing kisses towards him. One
      little girl was pushed in front of him, and she reached out a hand in
      which was a wild rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for luck, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac took the rose, and placed it in his buttonhole; then, stooping
      down, he kissed the child&rsquo;s cheek. Outside the hall, Barode Barouche
      winked an eye knowingly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it all down to a science. Look at him&mdash;kissing
      the young chick. Nevertheless, he&rsquo;s walking into an abyss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was near enough now for the confidence in his face to be seen.
      Barouche&rsquo;s eyes suddenly grew resentful. Sometimes he had a feeling of
      deep affection for his young challenger; sometimes there was a storm of
      anger in his bosom, a hatred which can be felt only for a member of one&rsquo;s
      own family. Resentment showed in his face now. This boy was winning
      friends on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the two men, some vibration of temperament, struck the same
      chord in Junia&rsquo;s life and being. She had noticed similar gestures, similar
      intonations of voice, and, above all else, a little toss of the head
      backwards. She knew they were not related, and so she put the whole thing
      down to Carnac&rsquo;s impressionable nature which led its owner into singular
      imitations. It had done so in the field of Art. He was young enough to be
      the imitator without loss to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing my best to defeat you,&rdquo; she said to Barouche, reaching out a
      hand for good-bye, &ldquo;and I shall work harder now than ever. You&rsquo;re so sure
      you&rsquo;re going to win that I&rsquo;d disappoint you, monsieur&mdash;only to do you
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m sorry you haven&rsquo;t any real interest in Carnac Grier, if it&rsquo;s only
      to do me good! Well, goodbye&mdash;good-bye,&rdquo; he added, raising his hat,
      and presently was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Carnac drew near, Fabian&rsquo;s wife stepped forward. &ldquo;Carnac,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
      hope you&rsquo;ll come with us on the river in Fabian&rsquo;s steam-launch. There&rsquo;s
      work to do there. It&rsquo;s pay-day in the lumber-yards on the Island, so
      please come. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughed. &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no engagement to prevent it.&rdquo; He thanked
      Junia and Sibyl for all they had done for him, and added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a
      couple of hours among the rivermen. Where&rsquo;s the boat?&rdquo; Fabian&rsquo;s wife told
      him, and added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the roan team here, and you can drive us down,
      if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments afterwards, with the cheers of the crowd behind them, they
      were being driven by Carnac to the wharf where lay the &ldquo;Fleur-de-lis.&rdquo; On
      board was Fabian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had a good meeting, Carnac?&rdquo; Fabian asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call it first-class. It was like a storm, at sea-wind from one
      direction, then from another, but I think on the whole we had the best of
      it. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; he added to Fabian&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, much the best,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Junia, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say so positively,&rdquo; answered Junia. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
      Monsieur Barouche. He talked as if he had something up his sleeve.&rdquo; Her
      face became clouded. &ldquo;Have you any idea what it is, Carnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac laughingly shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his way. He&rsquo;s always bluffing.
      He does it to make believe the game&rsquo;s his, and to destroy my confidence.
      He&rsquo;s a man of mark, but he&rsquo;s having the biggest fight he ever had&mdash;of
      that I&rsquo;m sure.... Do you think I&rsquo;ll win?&rdquo; he asked Junia presently with a
      laugh, as they made their way down the river. &ldquo;Have I conquest in my eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How seldom did Junia have Carnac to herself in these days! How kind of
      Fabian to lend his yacht for the purpose of canvassing! But Sibyl had in
      her mind a deeper thing&mdash;she had become a match-maker. She and
      Fabian, when the boat left the shore, went to one corner of the stern,
      leaving Carnac and Junia in the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three miles below the city was the Island on which many voters were
      working in a saw-mill and lumberyard. It had supporters of Barouche
      chiefly in the yards and mills. Carnac had never visited it, and it was
      Junia&rsquo;s view that he should ingratiate himself with the workers, a
      rough-and-ready lot. They were ready to &ldquo;burst a meeting&rdquo; or bludgeon a
      candidate on occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carnac asked his question Junia smiled up at him. &ldquo;Yes, I think
      you&rsquo;ll win, Carnac. You have the tide with you.&rdquo; Presently she added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not sure that you&rsquo;ve got all the cards, though&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why, but
      I have that fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I think Monsieur Barouche has some cards he hasn&rsquo;t played
      yet. What they are I don&rsquo;t know, but he&rsquo;s confident. Tell me, Carnac, is
      there any card that would defeat you? Have you committed any crime against
      the law&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m sure you haven&rsquo;t, but I want to hear you say so.&rdquo;
       She smiled cheerfully at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no card of any crime of mine, and he can&rsquo;t hit me in a mortal
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the right policy for this province. But tell me, is there anyone
      who could hurt you, who could spring up in the fight&mdash;man or woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him straight in the eye, and his own did not waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one has a knock-out blow for me&mdash;that&rsquo;s sure. I can
      weather any storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, however, disconcerted, for the memory of Luzanne came to him,
      and his spirit became clouded. &ldquo;Except one&mdash;except one,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t tell me who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;yet,&rdquo; answered Carnac. &ldquo;You ought to know;
      though you can&rsquo;t put things right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget you are a public man, and what might happen if things went
      wrong. There are those who would gladly roast you on a gridiron for what
      you are in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget it. I&rsquo;ve no crime to repent of, and I&rsquo;m afraid of nothing
      in the last resort. Look, we&rsquo;re nearing the Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your worst place in the constituency, and I&rsquo;m not sure of your
      reception. Oh, but yes, I am,&rdquo; she added hastily. &ldquo;You always win good
      feeling. No one really hates you. You&rsquo;re on the way to big success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some unexpected luck. I&rsquo;ve got Tarboe on my side. He&rsquo;s a member
      of Barouche&rsquo;s party, but he&rsquo;s coming with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you so?&rdquo; she asked with apparent interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a letter from him, and in it he says he is with me &lsquo;to the
      knife!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s good. Tarboe has a big hold on rivermen, and he may carry
      with him some of the opposition. It was a good letter&mdash;if puzzling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, puzzling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said in one part of it: &lsquo;When you come back here to play your part
      you&rsquo;ll make it a success, the whole blessed thing.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve no idea what he
      meant by that. I don&rsquo;t think he wants me as a partner, and I&rsquo;ll give him
      no chance of it. I don&rsquo;t want now what I could have had when Fabian left.
      That&rsquo;s all over, Junia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He meant something by it; he&rsquo;s a very able man,&rdquo; she replied gravely.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a huge success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And women love success more than all else,&rdquo; he remarked a little
      cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re unjust, Carnac. Of course, women love success; but they&rsquo;d not sell
      their souls for it&mdash;not the real women&mdash;and you ought to know
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to know it, I suppose,&rdquo; he answered, and he held her eyes
      meaningly. He was about to say something vital, but Fabian and his wife
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabian said to him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you get a bad reception here,
      Carnac. It&rsquo;s the worst place on the river, and I&rsquo;ve no influence over the
      men&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe Tarboe could have. They&rsquo;re a difficult lot.
      There&rsquo;s Eugene Grandois, he&rsquo;s as bad as they make &lsquo;em. He&rsquo;s got a grudge
      against us because of some act of father, and he may break out any time.
      He&rsquo;s a labour leader too, and we must be vigilant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac nodded. He made no reply in words. They were nearing the little
      dock, and men were coming to the point where the launch would stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Grandois now!&rdquo; said Fabian with a wry smile, for he had a real
      fear of results. He had, however, no idea how skilfully Carnac would
      handle the situation&mdash;yet he had heard much of his brother&rsquo;s
      adaptability. He had no psychological sense, and Carnac had big endowment
      of it. Yet Carnac was not demonstrative. It was his quiet way that played
      his game for him. He never spoke, if being could do what he wanted. He had
      the sense of physical speech with out words. He was a bold adventurer, but
      his methods were those of the subtlest. If a motion of the hand was
      sufficient, then let it go at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You people after our votes never come any other time,&rdquo; sneeringly said
      Eugene Grandois, as Carnac and Fabian landed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only when you want to
      use us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather I didn&rsquo;t come at all?&rdquo; asked Carnac with a friendly
      smile. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have it both ways. If I came here any other time you&rsquo;d
      want to know why I didn&rsquo;t stay away, and I come now because it&rsquo;s good you
      should know if I&rsquo;m fit to represent you in Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s sense, my bonny boy,&rdquo; said an English-Canadian labourer standing
      near. &ldquo;What you got to say to that, little skeezicks?&rdquo; he added teasingly
      to Eugene Grandois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got more gifts than his father had, and we all know what he was&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      so, bagosh!&rdquo; remarked Grandois viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what sort of a man was he?&rdquo; asked Carnac cooly, with a warning
      glance at Fabian, who was resentful. Indeed, Fabian would have struck the
      man if his brother had not been present, and then been torn to pieces
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know the kind of things he done? If you don&rsquo;t,
      I do, and there&rsquo;s lots of others know, and don&rsquo;t you forget it, mon
      vieux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no answer, Monsieur Grandois&mdash;none at all. It tells nothing,&rdquo;
       remarked Carnac cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got left out of his will, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, you talk as if he was all right&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      blither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father had a conscience. He gave me chance to become a partner in the
      business, and I wouldn&rsquo;t, and he threw me over&mdash;what else was there
      to do? I could have owned the business to-day, if I&rsquo;d played the game as
      he thought it ought to be played. I didn&rsquo;t, and he left me out&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makin&rsquo; your own way, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the English labourer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hit
      you where you&rsquo;re tender, Grandois. What you got to say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intense black eyes of the habitant sparkled wickedly, his jaws set
      with passion, and his sturdy frame seemed to fasten to the ground. His
      gnarled hands now shot out fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I got to say! Only this: John Grier played the devil&rsquo;s part. He
      turned me and my family out into the streets in winter-time, and the law
      upheld him, old beast that he was&mdash;sacre diable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beast-devil! Grandois, those are hard words about a man in his son&rsquo;s
      presence, and they&rsquo;re not true. You think you can say such things because
      I&rsquo;m standing for Parliament. Beast, devil, eh? You&rsquo;ve got a free tongue,
      Grandois; you forgot to say that my father paid the doctor&rsquo;s bill for your
      whole family when they were taken down with smallpox; and he kept them for
      weeks afterwards. You forgot to recall that when he turned you out for
      being six months behind with your rent and making no effort to pay up! Who
      was the devil and beast then, Grandois? Who spat upon his own wife and
      children then? You haven&rsquo;t a good memory.... Come, I think your account
      with my father is squared; and I want you to vote to put my father&rsquo;s son
      in Parliament, and to put out Barode Barouche, who&rsquo;s been there too long.
      Come, come, Grandois, isn&rsquo;t it a bargain? Your tongue&rsquo;s sharp, but your
      heart&rsquo;s in the right place&mdash;is it a bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand with applause from the crowd, but Grandois was not to
      be softened. His anger, however, had behind it some sense of caution, and
      what Carnac said about the smallpox incident struck him hard. It was the
      first time he had ever been hit between the eyes where John Grier was
      concerned. His prestige with the men was now under a shadow, yet he dared
      not deny the truth of the statement. It could be proved. His braggart
      hatred of John Grier had come home to roost. Carnac saw that, and he was
      glad he had challenged the man. He believed that in politics, as in all
      other departments of life, candour and bold play were best in the long
      run. Yet he would like to see the man in a different humour, and with joy
      he heard Junia say to Grandois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the baby boy, and how is madame, Monsieur Grandois?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came at the right moment, for only two days before had Madame Grandois
      given her husband the boy for which he had longed. Junia had come to know
      of it through a neighbour and had sent jellies to the sick woman. As she
      came forward now, Grandois, taken aback, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alors, they&rsquo;re all right, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle, thank you. It was you sent the
      jellies, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded with a smile. &ldquo;Yes, I sent them, Grandois. May I come and see
      madame and the boy to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The incident had taken a favourable turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about even-things between us, Grandois?&rdquo; asked Carnac, and held out
      his hand. &ldquo;My father hit you, but you hit him harder by forgetting about
      the smallpox and the rent, and also by drinking up the cash that ought to
      have paid the rent. It doesn&rsquo;t matter now that the rent was never paid,
      but it does that you recall the smallpox debt. Can&rsquo;t you say a word for
      me, Grandois? You&rsquo;re a big man here among all the workers. I&rsquo;m a better
      Frenchman than the man I&rsquo;m trying to turn out. Just a word for a good
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re waiting for you, and your hand on it! Here&rsquo;s a place for you on
      the roost. Come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;roost&rdquo; was an upturned tub lying face down on the ground, and in the
      passion of the moment, the little man gripped Carnac&rsquo;s hand and stood on
      the tub to great cheering; for if there was one thing the French-Canadians
      love, it is sensation, and they were having it. They were mostly
      Barouche&rsquo;s men, but they were emotional, and melodrama had stirred their
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, like the Irish, they had a love of feminine nature, and in all
      the river-coves Junia was known by sight at least, and was admired. She
      had the freshness of face and mind which is the heart of success with the
      habitants. With Eugene Grandois on his feet, she heard a speech which had
      in it the best spirit of Gallic eloquence, though it was crude. But it was
      forcible and adroit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends and comrades,&rdquo; said Eugene Grandois, with his hands playing
      loosely, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been misunderstandings between me and the Grier family,
      and I was out against it, but I see things different since M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac
      has spoke&mdash;and I&rsquo;m changing my mind&mdash;certainlee. That throwing
      out of my house hit me and my woman and little ones hard, and I&rsquo;ve been
      resentin&rsquo; it all these years till now; but I&rsquo;m weighin&rsquo; one thing agin
      another, and I&rsquo;m willing to forget my wrongs for this young man&rsquo;s sake.
      He&rsquo;s for us French. Alors, some of you was out to hurt our friend M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; 
      Carnac here, and I didn&rsquo;t say no to it; but you&rsquo;d better keep your weapons
      for election day and use them agin Barode Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a change of heart. I&rsquo;ve laid my plate on the table with a prayer
      that I get it filled with good political doctrine, and I&rsquo;ve promise that
      the food I&rsquo;m to get is what&rsquo;s best for all of us. M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac Grier&rsquo;s
      got the right stuff in him, and I&rsquo;m for him both hands up&mdash;both hands
      way up high, nom de pipe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that he raised both hands above his head with a loud cheer, and later
      Carnac Grier was carried to the launch in the arms of Eugene Grandois&rsquo; 
      friends.

      CHAPTER XXIV. THE BLUE PAPER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Who are you, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      It was in the house of Eugene Grandois that this question was asked of
      Junia. She had followed the experience on the Island by a visit to
      Grandois&rsquo; house, carrying delicacies for the sick wife. Denzil had come
      with her, and was waiting in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had almost ended her visit when the outer door opened and Luzanne
      Larue entered carrying a dish she placed on the table, eyeing Junia
      closely. First they bowed to each other, and Junia gave a pleasant smile,
      but instantly she felt here was a factor in her own life&mdash;how, she
      could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Luzanne, the face of Junia had no familiar feature, and yet she felt
      here was one whose life&rsquo;s lines crossed her own. So it was she presently
      said, &ldquo;Who are you, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo; in a sharp voice. As Junia did not reply
      at once, she put the question in another form: &ldquo;What is your name,
      ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Junia Shale,&rdquo; said the other calmly, yet with heart beating hard.
      Somehow the question foreshadowed painful things, associated with Carnac.
      Her first glance at Luzanne showed the girl was well dressed, that she had
      a face of some beauty, that her eyes were full of glamour&mdash;black and
      bold, and, in a challenging way, beautiful. It was a face and figure full
      of daring. She was not French-Canadian; yet she was French; that was clear
      from her accent. Yet the voice had an accent of crudity, and the plump
      whiteness of the skin and waving fulness of the hair gave the girl a look
      of an adventuress. She was dressed in black with a white collar which, by
      contrast, seemed to heighten her unusual nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Junia shuddered, for Luzanne&rsquo;s presence made her uneasy; yet the
      girl must have good qualities, for she had brought comforts to the sick
      woman, and indeed, within, madame had spoken of the &ldquo;dear beautiful
      stranger.&rdquo; That could be no other than this girl. She became composed. Yet
      she had a feeling that between them was a situation needing all her
      resources. About what? She would soon know, and she gave her name at last
      slowly, keeping her eyes on those of Luzanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      At mention of the name, Luzanne&rsquo;s eyes took on prejudice and moroseness.
      The pupils enlarged, the lids half closed, the face grew sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junia Shale&mdash;you are Junia Shale?&rdquo; The voice was bitter and
      resentful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia nodded, and in her smile was understanding and conflict, for she
      felt this girl to be her foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have a talk&mdash;that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; Luzanne said with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Junia calmly. &ldquo;I am Luzanne Larue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me no wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Carnac Grier spoken of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junia shook her head, and turned her face towards the door of Madame
      Grandois&rsquo; room. &ldquo;Had we not better go somewhere else to talk, after you&rsquo;ve
      seen Madame Grandois and the baby?&rdquo; she asked with a smile, yet she felt
      she was about to face an alarming event. &ldquo;Madame Grandois has spoken
      pleasantly of you to me,&rdquo; Junia added, for tact was her prompt faculty.
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d come where we could talk undisturbed&mdash;do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luzanne made no reply in words, but taking up the dish she went into the
      sick-room, and Junia heard her in short friendly speech with Madame
      Grandois. Luzanne appeared again soon and spoke: &ldquo;Now we can go where I&rsquo;m
      boarding. It&rsquo;s only three doors away, and we can be safe there. You&rsquo;d like
      to talk with me&mdash;ah, yes, surelee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were combative and repellent, but Junia was not dismayed, and she
      said: &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing and one person to talk about, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you engaged to Carnac Grier? Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re going to marry
      him?... Don&rsquo;t you like to tell the truth, then?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not engaged to Carnac Grier, and he has
      never asked me to marry him&mdash;but what business is it of yours,
      ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; Luzanne moved towards the door. They were
      speechless till they reached Luzanne&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the house of Monsieur Marmette, an agent of Monsieur Barouche,&rdquo;
       said Junia. &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know it better soon. The agent of M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Barouche is a man of
      mark about here, and he&rsquo;ll be more marked soon&mdash;but yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Monsieur Barouche will be elected, do you?&rdquo; asked Junia, as
      they closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working for Monsieur Grier, and that isn&rsquo;t my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working for Barode Barouche, and I know the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were now in Luzanne&rsquo;s small room, and Junia noted that it had all the
      characteristics of a habitant dwelling&mdash;even to the crucifix at the
      head of the bed, and the picture of the French-Canadian Premier of the
      Dominion on the wall. She also saw a rosary on a little hook beside the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am the wife of Carnac Grier, and I know what will happen to
      him.... You turn pale, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle, but your colour isn&rsquo;t going to alter
      the truth. I&rsquo;m Carnac Grier&rsquo;s wife by the laws of New York State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Monsieur Grier admit he is your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must respect the law by which he married me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he was ever honestly married to you,&rdquo; declared Junia.
      &ldquo;Has he ever lived with you&mdash;for a single day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference would that make? I have the marriage certificate here.&rdquo;
       She touched her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have thought you were Barode Barouche&rsquo;s wife by the way you act.
      Isn&rsquo;t it a wife&rsquo;s duty to help her husband&mdash;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be fighting
      against Barode Barouche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to be recognized as Carnac Grier&rsquo;s wife&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him since you&rsquo;ve been here? Have you told him how you&rsquo;re
      working against him? Have you got the certificate with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ve got my head on like a piece of flesh and blood that
      belongs to me&mdash;bien sur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly drew from her breast a folded piece of blue paper. &ldquo;There it
      is, signed by Judge Grimshaw that married us, and there&rsquo;s the seal; and
      the whole thing can&rsquo;t be set aside. Look at it, if you like, petite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held it not far from Junia&rsquo;s face, and Junia could see that it was
      registration of a marriage of New York State. She could have snatched the
      paper away, but she meant to conquer Luzanne&rsquo;s savage spirit. &ldquo;Well, how
      do you intend to defeat your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to have the people asked from a platform if they&rsquo;ve seen the wife
      of the candidate, and then a copy of the certificate will be read to all.
      What do you think will happen after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will have to be done to-night or to-morrow night,&rdquo; remarked Junia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the election comes the day after to-morrow,&mdash;eh
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of that. And who will read the document?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who but the man he&rsquo;s trying to defeat?&mdash;tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Barode Barouche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he agreed to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luzanne nodded. &ldquo;On the day&mdash;Carnac became a candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if Carnac Grier denies it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t deny it. He never has. He says he was drunk when the thing was
      done&mdash;mais, oui.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all he says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He says he didn&rsquo;t know it was a real marriage, and&mdash;&rdquo; Luzanne
      then related Carnac&rsquo;s defence, and added: &ldquo;Do you think anyone would
      believe him with the facts as they are? Remember I&rsquo;m French and he&rsquo;s
      English, and that marriage to a French girl is life and death; and this is
      a French province!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you are a Catholic and French, and were married by a Protestant
      judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my own affair, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the thing to say to French-Canadians here. What do you get out
      of it all? If he is your husband, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have him
      successful than your defeated victim. What will be yours if you defeat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge&mdash;my rights&mdash;the law!&rdquo; was the sharp rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia smiled. &ldquo;What is there in it all for you? If the man I married did
      not love me, I&rsquo;d use the law to be free. What&rsquo;s the good of trying to
      destroy a husband who doesn&rsquo;t love you, who never loved you&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; retorted Luzanne sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. He never loved you. He never lived with you for a single day.
      That&rsquo;s in the power of a doctor to prove. If you are virtuous, then he has
      taken nothing; if you have given your all, and not to Carnac Grier, what
      will his mind be about you? Is it money? He has no money except what he
      earns. His father left him nothing&mdash;not a dollar. Why do you hate him
      so? I&rsquo;ve known him all my life, and I&rsquo;ve never known him hurt man or
      animal. When did he ever misuse you, or hurt you? Did he ever treat you
      badly? How did you come to know him? Answer that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused and Luzanne flushed. The first meeting! Why, that was the day
      Carnac had saved her life, had taken her home safe from danger, and had
      begun a friendship with behind it only a desire to help her. And how had
      she repaid the saviour of her life? By tricking him into a marriage, and
      then by threatening him if he did not take her to his home. Truth is, down
      beneath her misconduct was a passion for the man which, not satisfied,
      became a passion to destroy him and his career. It was a characteristic of
      her blood and breed. It was a relic of ancient dishonour, inherited and
      searching; it was atavism and the incorrigible thing. Beneath everything
      was her desire for the man, and the mood in which she had fought for him
      was the twist of a tortured spirit. She was not so deliberate as her
      actions had indicated. She had been under the malicious influence of her
      father and her father&rsquo;s friend. She was like one possessed of a spirit
      that would not be deterred from its purpose. Junia saw the impression she
      had made, and set it down to her last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you first meet him? What was the way of it?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Junia came forward and put her hands on Luzanne&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;I
      think you loved Carnac once, and perhaps you love him now, and are only
      trying to hurt him out of anger. If you destroy him, you will repent of it&mdash;so
      soon! I don&rsquo;t know what is behind these things you are doing, but you&rsquo;ll
      be sorry for it when it is too late. Yes, I know you have loved Carnac,
      for I see all the signs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love him then, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo; asked Luzanne exasperated. &ldquo;Do you
      love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never asked me, and I have never told him that; and I don&rsquo;t know,
      but, if I did, I would move heaven and earth to help him, and if he didn&rsquo;t
      love me I&rsquo;d help him just the same. And so, I think, should you. If you
      ever loved him, then you ought to save him from evil. Tell me, did Carnac
      ever do you a kind act, one that is worth while in your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Luzanne stood dismayed, then a new expression drove the dark
      light from her eyes. It was as though she had found a new sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saved my life the day we first met,&rdquo; she said at last under Junia&rsquo;s
      hypnotic influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you would strike him when he is trying to do the big thing. You
      threaten to declare his marriage, in the face of those who can elect him
      to play a great part for his country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junia saw the girl was in emotional turmoil, was obsessed by one idea, and
      she felt her task had vast difficulty. That Carnac should have married the
      girl was incredible, that he had played an unworthy part seemed sure; yet
      it was in keeping with his past temperament. The girl was the extreme
      contrast of himself, with dark&mdash;almost piercing-eyes, and a paleness
      which was physically constitutional&mdash;the joy of the artistic spirit.
      It was the head of a tragedienne or a martyr, and the lean, rather
      beautiful body was eloquent of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Junia said: &ldquo;To try to spoil him would be a crime against his
      country, and I shall tell him you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do nothing at all.&rdquo; The French girl&rsquo;s words were suddenly biting,
      malicious and defiant. The moment&rsquo;s softness she had felt was gone, and
      hardness returned. &ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t moved against me since he married me, he
      wouldn&rsquo;t dare do so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t he moved? Because you&rsquo;re a woman, and also he&rsquo;d believe you&rsquo;d
      repent of your conduct. But I believe he will act sternly against you at
      once. There is much at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want it for your own sake,&rdquo; said Luzanne sharply. &ldquo;You think he&rsquo;d
      marry you if I gave him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;d ask me to marry him, if you weren&rsquo;t in the way, but I&rsquo;d have
      my own mind about that, and knowing what you&rsquo;ve told me&mdash;truth or lie&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      weigh it all carefully. Besides, he&rsquo;s not the only man. Doesn&rsquo;t that ever
      strike you? Why try to hold him by a spurious bond when there are other
      men as good-looking, as clever? Is your world so bare of men&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m
      sure it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she added, for she saw anger rising in the impulsive girl.
      &ldquo;There are many who&rsquo;d want to marry you, and it&rsquo;s better to marry some one
      who loves you than to hold to one who doesn&rsquo;t love you at all. Is it hate?
      He saved your life&mdash;and that&rsquo;s how you came to know him first, and
      now you would destroy him! He&rsquo;s a great man. He would not bend to his
      father&rsquo;s will, and so he was left without a sou of his father&rsquo;s money. All
      because he has a conscience, and an independence worthy of the best that
      ever lived.... That&rsquo;s the soul of the man you are trying to hurt. If you
      had a real soul, there wouldn&rsquo;t be even the thought of this crime. Do you
      think he wouldn&rsquo;t loathe you, if you do this ghastly thing? Would any real
      man endure it for an hour? What do you expect to get but ugly revenge on a
      man who never gave anything except friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendship&mdash;friendship-yes, he gave that, but emotion too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that real men marry women for whom they only have emotion. You
      think that he&mdash;Carnac Grier&mdash;would marry any woman on that
      basis? Come, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle, the truth! He didn&rsquo;t know he was being married,
      and when you told him it was a real marriage he left you at once. You and
      yours tricked him&mdash;the man you&rsquo;d never have known if he hadn&rsquo;t saved
      your life. You thought that with your beauty&mdash;yes, you are beautiful&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      conquer him, and that he&rsquo;d give in, and become a real husband in a real
      home. Come now, isn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other did not reply. Her face was alive with memories. The lower
      things were flying from it, a spirit of womanhood was living in her&mdash;feebly,
      but truly, living. She was now conscious of the insanity of her pursuit of
      Carnac. For a few moments she stood silent, and then she said with
      agitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I give this up&rdquo;&mdash;she took from her breast the blue document&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;d
      be safe in his election, and he&rsquo;d marry you: is it not so, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be safe for his election, but he has never asked me to marry him,
      and there are others besides him.&rdquo;&mdash;She was thinking of Tarboe. &ldquo;Tell
      me,&rdquo; she added suddenly, &ldquo;to whom have you told this thing in Montreal?
      Did you mean to challenge him yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told it only to M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Barouche, and he said he would use it at the
      right moment&mdash;and the right moment has come,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;He asked me
      for a copy of it last night, and I said I&rsquo;d give it to him to-day. It&rsquo;s
      because of him I&rsquo;ve been here quiet all these weeks as Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle Larue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is worse than you, mademoiselle, for he has known Carnac&rsquo;s family, and
      he has no excuse. If a man can&rsquo;t win his fight fairly, he oughtn&rsquo;t to be
      in public life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few dark moments, with a sudden burst of feeling, Luzanne said:
      &ldquo;Well, Carnac won&rsquo;t be out of public life through me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the blue certificate from her breast and was about to tear it up,
      when Junia stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Junia said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tear it up yet, give it to me. I&rsquo;ll
      tear it up at the right moment. Give it to me, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, and the blue certificate was presently in her
      fingers. She felt a sudden weakness in her knees, for it seemed she held
      the career of Carnac Grier, and it moved her as she had never been moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the yielding of the certificate, Luzanne seemed suddenly to lose
      self-control. She sank on the bed beside the wall with a cry of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu&mdash;oh, Mon Dieu!&rdquo; Then she sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Give it back,
      give it back tome,&rdquo; she cried, with frantic pain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I have of him&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      all I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give it back,&rdquo; declared Junia quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s career, and
      you must let it go. It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. Let it stand,
      mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fully realized the half-insane mind and purpose of the girl, and she
      wrapped her arms around the stricken figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use. You can&rsquo;t have it back. Your soul
      is too big for that now. You can be happy in the memory that you gave
      Carnac back his freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the record stands,&rdquo; said the girl helplessly. &ldquo;Tell the truth and
      have it removed. You owe that to the man who saved your life. Have it done
      at once at Shipton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do with the certificate?&rdquo; She glanced at Junia&rsquo;s bosom
      where the paper was hidden. &ldquo;I will give it to Carnac, and he can do what
      he likes with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By now the tears were streaming down the face of Luzanne Larue, and hard
      as it was for Junia, she tried to comfort her, for the girl should be got
      away at once, and only friendliness could achieve that. She would see
      Denzil&mdash;he was near by, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be a train in two hours for New York and the girl must take
      it-she must.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. DENZIL TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Barode Baruche was excited. He had sure hope of defeating Carnac with the
      help of Luzanne Larue. The woman had remained hidden since her coming, and
      the game was now in his hands. On the night before the poll he could
      declare the thing, not easy to be forgiven by the French-Canadian public,
      which has a strong sense of domestic duty. Carnac Grier was a Protestant,
      and that was bad, and if there was added an offence against domestic
      morality, he would be beaten at the polls as sure as the river ran. He had
      seen Luzanne several times, and though he did not believe in her, he knew
      the marriage certificate was real. He had no credence in Carnac&rsquo;s lack of
      honour, yet it was strange he had not fought his wife, if his case was a
      good one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day he had felt Carnac&rsquo;s power growing, and he feared his triumph
      unless some sensation stopped it. Well, he had at hand the sufficient
      sensation. He would produce both the certificate of marriage and the
      French girl who was the legal wife of Carnac Grier. That Luzanne was
      French helped greatly, for it would be used by Carnac&rsquo;s foes as an insult
      to French Canada, and his pulses throbbed as he thought of the possible
      turmoil in the constituency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the girl was handsome, had ability, and spoke English with a
      French accent, and she was powerful for his purposes. He was out to
      prevent his own son from driving himself into private life, and he would
      lose no trick in the game, if he could help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentimental feeling&mdash;yes, he had it, but it did not prevent him from
      saving his own skin. Carnac had come out against him, and he must hit as
      hard as he could. It was not as though Carnac had been guilty of a real
      crime and was within the peril of the law. His offence was a personal one,
      but it would need impossible defence at the moment of election. In any
      case, if Carnac was legally married, he should assume the responsibilities
      of married life; and if he had honest reason for not recognizing the
      marriage, he should stop the woman from pursuing him. If the case kept
      Carnac out of public life and himself in, then justice would be done; for
      it was monstrous that a veteran should be driven into obscurity by a boy.
      In making his announcement he would be fighting his son as though he was a
      stranger and not of his own blood and bones. He had no personal connection
      with Carnac in the people&rsquo;s minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the day that Junia had had her hour with Luzanne, he
      started for the house where Luzanne was lodging. He could not travel the
      streets without being recognized, but it did not matter, for the house
      where the girl lodged was that of his sub agent, and he was safe in going
      to it. He did not know, however, that Denzil had been told by Junia to
      watch the place and learn what he meant to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil had a popular respect of Barode Barouche as a Minister of the
      Crown; but he had a far greater love of Carnac. He remained vigilant until
      after Junia and Luzanne had started in a cab for the railway-station. They
      left near three-quarters of an hour before the train was to start for New
      York; and for the first quarter of an hour after they left, Denzil was in
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw Barouche enter the street and go to the house of his
      sub-agent. The house stood by itself, with windows open, and Denzil did
      not scruple to walk near it, and, if possible, listen. Marmette, the
      subagent, would know of the incident between Junia and Luzanne; and he
      feared. Barouche might start for the station, overtake Luzanne and prevent
      her leaving. He drew close and kept his ears open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fortunate, he heard voices; Marmette was explaining to Barouche
      that Junia and Luzanne had gone to the station, as &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle&rdquo; was bound
      for New York. Marmette had sent word to M. Barouche by messenger, but the
      messenger had missed him. Then he heard Barouche in anger say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool&mdash;why did you let her leave! It&rsquo;s my bread and butter&mdash;and
      yours too&mdash;that&rsquo;s at stake. I wanted to use her against Grier. She
      was my final weapon of attack. How long ago did she leave?&rdquo; Marmette told
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denzil saw Barode Barouche leave the house with grim concern and talking
      hard to Paul Marmette. He knew the way they would go, so he fell behind a
      tree, and saw them start for the place where they could order a cab. Then
      he followed them. Looking at his watch he saw that, if they got a cab,
      they would get to the station before the train started, and he wondered
      how he could retard Barouche. A delay of three minutes would be enough,
      for it was a long way, and the distance could only be covered with good
      luck in the time. Yet Denzil had hope, for his faith in Junia was great,
      and he felt sure she would do what she planned. He had to trot along fast,
      because Barouche and Marmette were going hard, and he could not see his
      way to be of use yet. He would give his right hand to help Carnac win
      against the danger Junia had suggested. It could not be aught to Carnac&rsquo;s
      discredit, or Junia would not have tried to get the danger out of
      Montreal; he had seen Luzanne, and she might be deadly, if she had a good
      weapon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, he saw Barouche and his agent stop at the door of a
      livery-stable, and were told that no cabs were available. There were none
      in the street, and time was pressing. Not far away, however, was a street
      with a tram-line, and this tram would take Barouche near the station from
      which Luzanne would start. So Barouche made hard for this street and had
      reached it when a phaeton came along, and in it was one whom Barouche
      knew. Barouche spoke to the occupant, and presently both men were admitted
      to the phaeton just as a tram-car came near.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the phaeton would make the distance to the station in less time than
      the car, this seemed the sensible thing to do, and Denzil&rsquo;s spirits fell.
      There remained enough time for Barouche to reach the station before the
      New York train started! He got aboard the tram himself, and watched the
      phaeton moving quickly on ahead. He saw the driver of the phaeton strike
      his horse with a whip, and the horse, suddenly breaking into a gallop,
      slipped and fell to the ground on the tramtrack. A moment later the tram
      came to a stop behind the fallen horse, and Denzil saw the disturbed face
      of Barode Barouche looking for another trap&mdash;in any case, it would
      take three or four minutes to get the horse up and clear the track for the
      tram. There was no carriage in sight&mdash;only a loaded butcher&rsquo;s cart, a
      road-cleaner, and a heavily loaded van. These could be of no use to
      Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his corner, Denzil saw the play with anxious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was presently found that the horse had injured a leg in falling and
      could not be got to its feet, but had presently to be dragged from the
      tram-lines. It had all taken near five minutes of the time before the
      train went, and, with despair, Barouche mounted the steps of the tram. He
      saw Denzil, and shrewdly suspected he was working in the interests of
      Carnac. He came forward to Denzil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long way from home, little man,&rdquo; he said in a voice with an acid
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the same as you from home, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Denzil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got business everywhere in this town,&rdquo; remarked Barouche with
      sarcasm&mdash;&ldquo;and you haven&rsquo;t, have you? You&rsquo;re travelling privately,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I travel as m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; travels, and on the same business,&rdquo; answered Denzil
      with a challenging smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look Barouche gave him then Denzil never forgot. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you
      were in politics, mon vieux! What are you standing for? When are you going
      to the polls&mdash;who are you fighting, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fighting you, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, though I ain&rsquo;t in politics, and I&rsquo;m going to
      the polls now,&rdquo; Denzil answered. Denzil had gained in confidence as he saw
      the arrogance of Barode Barouche. He spoke with more vigour than usual,
      and he felt his gorge rising, for here was a man trying to injure his
      political foe through a woman; and Denzil resented it. He did not know the
      secret of Luzanne Larue, but he did realize there was conflict between
      Junia Shale and Barouche, and between Barouche and Carnac Grier, and that
      enlisted his cooperation. By nature he was respectful; but the politician
      now was playing a dirty game, and he himself might fight without gloves,
      if needed. That was why his eyes showed defiance at Barouche now. He had
      said the thing which roused sharp anger in Barouche. It told Barouche that
      Denzil knew where he was going and why. Anger shook him as he saw Denzil
      take out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poll closes in three minutes, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; Denzil added with a dry
      smile, for it was clear Barouche could not reach the station in time, if
      the train left promptly. The swiftest horses could not get him there, and
      these were not the days of motor-cars. Yet it was plain Barouche meant to
      stick to it, and he promptly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t the right time, beetle. The poll closes only when the train
      leaves, and your watch doesn&rsquo;t show that, so don&rsquo;t put on airs yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put on airs if I&rsquo;ve won, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; Denzil answered quietly, for he
      saw people in the tram were trying to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barouche had been recognized, and a murmur of cheering began, followed by
      a hum of disapproval, for Barouche had lost many friends since Carnac had
      come into the fray. A few folk tried to engage Barouche in talk, but he
      responded casually; yet he smiled the smile which had done so much for him
      in public life, and the distance lessened to the station. The tram did not
      go quite to the station, and as it stopped, the two men hurried to the
      doors. As they did so, an engine gave a scream, and presently, as they
      reached the inside of the station, they saw passing out at the far end,
      the New York train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She started five minutes late, but she did start,&rdquo; said Denzil, and there
      was malice in his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked at his watch, he saw Junia passing out of a door into the
      street, but Barode Barouche did not see her&mdash;his eyes were fixed on
      the departing train.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Barouche stood indecisive as to whether he should hire a
      locomotive and send some one after the train, and so get in touch with
      Luzanne in that way, or send her a telegram to the first station where the
      train would stop in its schedule; but presently he gave up both ideas. As
      he turned towards the exit of the station, he saw Denzil, and he came
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve won, mon petit chien,&rdquo; he said with vindictiveness, &ldquo;but
      my poll comes to-morrow night, and I shall win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No game is won till it&rsquo;s all played, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, and this innings is mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fighting a bigger man than you, wasp,&rdquo; snarled Barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As big as yourself and bigger, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Denzil with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that in his tone which made Barouche regard him closely. He saw
      there was no real knowledge of the relationship of Carnac and himself in
      Denzil&rsquo;s eyes; but he held out his hand with imitation courtesy, as though
      to say good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a love-clasp, spider,&rdquo; he said with a kind of sneer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
      your love as I travel to triumph.&rdquo; A light of hatred came into Denzil&rsquo;s
      eyes. &ldquo;Beetledog&mdash;wasp&mdash;spider&rdquo; he had been called by this big
      man&mdash;well, he should see that the wasp could give as good as it got.
      His big gnarled hand enclosed the hand of Barode Barouche, then he
      suddenly closed on it tight. He closed on it till he felt it crunching in
      his own and saw that the face of Barode Barouche was like that of one in a
      chair of torture. He squeezed, till from Barouche&rsquo;s lips came a gasp of
      agony, and then he let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had my love-clasp, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; Denzil said with meaning, &ldquo;and when
      you want it again let me know. It&rsquo;s what M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac will do with you
      to-morrow night. Only he&rsquo;ll not let go, as I did, before the blood comes.
      Don&rsquo;t be hard on those under you, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. Remember wasps and spiders can
      sting in their own way, and that dogs can bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little black beast,&rdquo; was the short reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strip your hide for
      Hell&rsquo;s gridiron in good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, but you&rsquo;ll be in hell waiting, for I&rsquo;m going to bury you
      here where you call better men than yourself dogs and wasps and spiders
      and beetles. And I&rsquo;ll not strip your &lsquo;hide,&rsquo; either. That&rsquo;s for lower men
      than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later they parted, Denzil to find Junia, and Barouche to prepare
      his speech for the evening. Barouche pondered. What should he do&mdash;should
      he challenge Carnac with his marriage with Luzanne Larue? His heart was
      beating hard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. THE CHALLENGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day of the election came. Never had feeling run higher, never had
      racial lines been so cut across. Barode Barouche fought with vigour, but
      from the going of Luzanne Larue, there passed from him the confidence he
      had felt since the first day of Carnac&rsquo;s candidature. He had had
      temptation to announce to those who heard him the night before the poll
      what Luzanne had told; but better wisdom guided him, to his subsequent
      content. He had not played a scurvy trick on his son for his own personal
      advantage. Indeed, when his meetings were all over, he was thankful for
      the disappearance of Luzanne. At heart he was not all bad. A madness had
      been on him. He, therefore, slept heavily from midnight till morning on
      the eve of the election, and began the day with the smile of one who
      abides the result with courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times he came upon Carnac in the streets, and they saluted
      courteously; yet he saw the confidence of Carnac in his bearing. Twice
      also he came upon Junia and he was startled by the look she gave him. It
      was part of his punishment that Junia was the source of his undoing where
      Luzanne was concerned. Junia knew about Luzanne; but if she condemned him
      now, what would she think if she knew that Carnac was his own son!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A devilish clever girl that,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;If he wins, it&rsquo;ll be
      due to her, and if he wins&mdash;no, he can&rsquo;t marry her, for he&rsquo;s already
      married; but he&rsquo;ll owe it all to her. If he wins!... No, he shall not win;
      I&rsquo;ve been in the game too long; I&rsquo;ve served too many interests; I&rsquo;ve
      played too big a part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then he met his agent, who said: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re making strong play
      against us&mdash;the strongest since you began politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong enough to put us in danger?&rdquo; inquired Barouche. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been at
      the game here for thirty years, and I&rsquo;d like to know what you think&mdash;quite
      honestly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His agent was disturbed. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re in danger; he has all your gifts,
      and he&rsquo;s as clever as Old Nick besides. He&rsquo;s a man that&rsquo;ll make things
      hum, if he gets in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he gets in&mdash;you think...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has as good a chance as you, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s a list of doubtful ones,
      and you&rsquo;ll see they&rsquo;re of consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are indeed,&rdquo; said Barouche, scanning the list. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea these
      would be doubtful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luke Tarboe&rsquo;s working like the devil for Carnac. People believe in him.
      Half the men on that list were affected by Tarboe&rsquo;s turning over. Tarboe
      is a master-man; he has fought like hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve been too long at it to miss it now,&rdquo; said the rueful
      member with a forced smile. &ldquo;I must win now, or my game is up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent nodded, but there was no certainty in his eye. Feeling ran
      higher and higher, but there was no indication that Barouche&rsquo;s hopes were
      sure of fulfilment. His face became paler as the day wore on, and his
      hands freer with those of his late constituents. Yet he noticed that
      Carnac was still glib with his tongue and freer with his hands. Carnac
      seemed everywhere, on every corner, in every street, at every polling
      booth; he laid his trowel against every brick in the wall. Carnac was not
      as confident as he seemed, but he was nearing the end of the trail; and
      his feet were free and his head clear. One good thing had happened. The
      girl who could do him great harm was not in evidence, and it was too late
      to spoil his chances now, even if she came. What gave him greatest hope
      was the look on Junia&rsquo;s face as he passed her. It was the sign of the
      conqueror&mdash;something he could not under stand. It was knowledge and
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, he had a new feeling towards Tarboe, who had given him such powerful
      support. There was, then, in the man the bigger thing, the light of
      fairness and reason! He had had no talk with Tarboe, and he desired none,
      but he had seen him at three of his meetings, and he had evidence of
      arduous effort on his behalf. Tarboe had influenced many people in his
      favour, men of standing and repute, and the workmen of the Grier firm had
      come, or were coming, his way. He had always been popular with them, in
      spite of the strike he had fought, but they voted independently of their
      employers; and he was glad to know that most of them were with him in the
      fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      His triumph over Eugene Grandois at the Island had been a good influence,
      and he had hopes of capturing the majority of the river people. Yet,
      strange to say, the Church had somewhat reversed its position, and at the
      last had swung round to Barouche, quietly, though not from the pulpit,
      supporting him. The old prejudice in favour of a Catholic and a Frenchman
      was alive again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac was keyed to anxiety, but outwardly seemed moving with brilliant
      certainty. He walked on air, and he spoke and acted like one who had the
      key of the situation in his fingers, and the button of decision at his
      will. It was folly electioneering on the day of the poll, and yet he saw a
      few labour leaders and moved them to greater work for him. One of these
      told him that at the Grier big-mill was one man working to defeat him by
      personal attacks. It had something to do with a so-called secret marriage,
      and it would be good to get hold of the man, Roudin, as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A secret marriage! So the thing had, after all, been bruited and used-what
      was the source of the information? Who was responsible? He must go to the
      mill at once, and he started for it. On the way he met Luke Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble down at the mill,&rdquo; Tarboe said. &ldquo;A fellow called Roudin
      has been spreading a story that you&rsquo;re married and repudiate your wife.
      It&rsquo;d be good to fight it now before it gets going. There&rsquo;s no truth in it,
      of course,&rdquo; he added with an opposite look in his eye, for he remembered
      the letter Carnac received one day in the office and his own conclusion
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, and I&rsquo;ll go and see Roudin at once.... You&rsquo;ve been a good
      friend to me in the fight, Tarboe, and I&rsquo;d like a talk when it&rsquo;s all
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be easy enough, Grier. Don&rsquo;t make any mistake-this is a big thing
      you&rsquo;re doing; and if a Protestant Britisher can beat a Catholic Frenchman
      in his own habitant seat, it&rsquo;s the clinching of Confederation. We&rsquo;ll talk
      it over when you&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m going to win?&rdquo; asked Carnac with thumping heart, for the
      stark uncertainty seemed to overpower him, though he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the lie doesn&rsquo;t get going too hard, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll pull it off.
      There&rsquo;s my hand on it. I&rsquo;d go down with you to the mill, but you should go
      alone. You&rsquo;ve got your own medicine to give. Go it alone, Grier. It&rsquo;s best&mdash;and
      good luck to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Carnac was in the yard of the mill, and in one corner
      he saw the man he took to be Roudin talking to a group of workmen. He
      hurried over, and heard Roudin declaring that he, Carnac, was secretly
      married to a woman whom he repudiated, and was that the kind of man to
      have as member of Parliament? Presently Roudin was interrupted by cheers
      from supporters of Carnac, and he saw it was due to Carnac&rsquo;s arrival.
      Roudin had courage. He would not say behind a man&rsquo;s back what he would not
      say to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just telling my friends here, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, that you was married, and
      you didn&rsquo;t acknowledge your wife. Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac&rsquo;s first impulse was to say No, but he gained time by challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say such things to injure me? Is that what Monsieur Barouche
      tells you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roudin shook his head protestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Monsieur Barouche does that he oughtn&rsquo;t to hold the seat, he ought to
      be sent back to his law offices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t hear it from M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Barouche. I get it from better hands
      than his,&rdquo; answered Roudin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better hands than his, eh? From the lady herself, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from the lady herself, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then bring the lady here and let us have it out, monsieur. It&rsquo;s a lie.
      Bring the lady here, if you know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roudin shrugged a shoulder. &ldquo;I know what I know, and I don&rsquo;t have to do
      what you say&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not honest. You do me harm by a story like that. I challenge
      you, and you don&rsquo;t respond. You say you know the woman, then produce her&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no time to be lost. The poll closes in four hours. If you make such
      statements, prove them. It isn&rsquo;t playing the game&mdash;do you think so,
      messieurs?&rdquo; he added to the crowd which had grown in numbers. At that
      moment a man came running from the en trance towards Carnac. It was
      Denzil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter for you, an important letter,&rdquo; he kept crying as he came nearer.
      He got the letter into Carnac&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it at once, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,&rdquo; Denzil said urgently. Carnac saw the
      handwriting was Junia&rsquo;s, and he tore open the letter, which held the blue
      certificate of the marriage with Luzanne. He conquered the sudden dimness
      of his eyes, and read the letter. It said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DEAR CARNAC,

   I hear from Mr. Tarboe of the lies being told against you. Here is
   the proof. She has gone. She told it to Barode Barouche, and he
   was to have announced it last night, but I saw her first. You can
   now deny the story. The game is yours. Tell the man Roudin to
   produce the woman&mdash;she is now in New York, if the train was not
   lost. I will tell you all when you are M.P.
                            JUNIA.
</pre>
    <p>
      With a smile, Carnac placed the certificate in his pocket. How lucky it
      was he had denied the marriage and demanded that Roudin produce the woman!
      He was safe now, safe and free. It was no good any woman declaring she was
      married to him if she could not produce the proof&mdash;and the proof was
      in his pocket and the woman was in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Monsieur Roudin, tell us about the woman, and bring her to the
      polls. There is yet time, if you&rsquo;re telling the truth. Who is she? Where
      does she live? What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Carnac Grier&mdash;that&rsquo;s her name,&rdquo; responded Roudin with a snarl,
      and the crowd laughed, for Carnac&rsquo;s boldness gave them a sense of
      security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her maiden name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larue,&rdquo; answered the other sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her Christian name, since you know so much, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no fear now, and his question was audacity, but he knew the game
      was with him, and he took the risks. His courage had reward, for Roudin
      made no reply. Carnac turned to the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a man tried to ruin my character by telling a story about a woman
      whose name he doesn&rsquo;t know. Is that playing the game after the rules&mdash;I
      ask you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were cries from the crowd supporting him, and he grew bolder. &ldquo;Let
      the man tell his story and I&rsquo;ll meet it here face to face. I fear nothing.
      Out with your story, monsieur. Tell us why you haven&rsquo;t brought her into
      the daylight, why she isn&rsquo;t claiming her husband at the polls. What&rsquo;s the
      story? Let&rsquo;s have it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, Roudin dared not tell what he knew. It was based wholly on
      a talk he had partly overheard between Barode Barouche and Luzanne in the
      house where she stayed and where he, Roudin, lodged. It had not been
      definite, and he had no proofs. He was a sensationalist, and he had had
      his hour and could say no more, because of Barode Barouche. He could not
      tell the story of his overhearing, for why had not Barouche told the tale?
      With an oath he turned away and disappeared. As he went he could hear his
      friends cheering Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carnac Grier lies, but he wins the game,&rdquo; he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. EXIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grier&rsquo;s in&mdash;Carnac&rsquo;s in&mdash;Carnac&rsquo;s got the seat!&rdquo; This was the
      cry heard in the streets at ten-thirty at night when Carnac was found
      elected by a majority of one hundred and ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnac had not been present at the counting of the votes until the last
      quarter-hour, and then he was told by his friends of the fluctuations of
      the counting&mdash;how at one time his defeat seemed assured, since Barode
      Barouche was six hundred ahead, and his own friends had almost given up
      hope. One of his foes, however, had no assurance of Carnac&rsquo;s defeat. He
      was too old an agent to believe in returns till all were in, and he knew
      of the two incidents by which Carnac had got advantage&mdash;at the Island
      over Eugene Grandois, and at the Mill over Roudin the very day of polling;
      and it was at these points he had hoped to score for Barouche a majority.
      He watched Barouche, and he deplored the triumph in his eye, for there was
      no surety of winning; his own was the scientific mind without emotions or
      passions. He did not &ldquo;enthuse,&rdquo; and he did not despair; he kept his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there were fluctuations in favour of Carnac, and the six hundred
      by which Barouche led were steadily swallowed up; he saw that among the
      places which gave Carnac a majority were the Island and the Mill. He was
      also nonplussed by Carnac&rsquo;s coolness. For a man with an artist&rsquo;s
      temperament, he was well controlled. When he came into the room, he went
      straight to Barouche and shook hands with him, saying they&rsquo;d soon offer
      congratulations to the winner. As the meeting took place the agent did not
      fail to note how alike in build and manner were the two men, how similar
      were their gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the Returning Officer announced the result, the agent dared
      not glance at his defeated chief. Yet he saw him go to Carnac and offer a
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a straight fight, Grier, and I hope you&rsquo;ll have luck in
      Parliament. This is no place for me. It&rsquo;s your game, and I&rsquo;ll eat my sour
      bread alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He motioned to the window with a balcony, beyond which were the shouting
      thousands. Then he smiled at Carnac, and in his heart he was glad he had
      not used the facts about Luzanne before the public. The boy&rsquo;s face was so
      glowing that his own youth came back, and a better spirit took residence
      in him. He gave thanks to the Returning Officer, and then, with his agent,
      left the building by the back door. He did not wait for the announcement
      of Carnac&rsquo;s triumph, and he knew his work was done for ever in public
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he had said his say at the club where his supporters, discomfited,
      awaited him. To demands for a speech, he said he owed to his workers what
      he could never repay, and that the long years they had kept him in
      Parliament would be the happiest memory of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon have you back,&rdquo; shouted a voice from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good fight,&rdquo; said Barode Barouche. Somehow the fact he had
      not beaten his son by the story of his secret marriage was the sole
      comfort he had. He advised his followers to &ldquo;play the game&rdquo; and let the
      new member have his triumph without belittlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best fight I&rsquo;ve had in thirty years,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
      been beaten fairly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another hour he was driving into the country on his way to visit an old
      ex-Cabinet Minister, who had been his friend through all the years of his
      Parliamentary life. It did not matter that the hour was late. He knew the
      veteran would be waiting for him, and unprepared for the bad news he
      brought. The night was spent in pain of mind, and the comfort the
      ex-Minister gave him, that a seat would be found for him by the
      Government, gave him no thrill. He knew he had enemies in the Government,
      that the Prime Minister was the friend of the successful only, and that
      there were others, glad of his defeat, who would be looking for his place.
      Also he was sure he had injured the chances of the Government by the
      defeat of his policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though Creation was in league against him, a heavy storm broke about
      two o&rsquo;clock, and he went to bed cursed by torturing thoughts. &ldquo;Chickens
      come home to roost&mdash;&rdquo; Why did that ancient phrase keep ringing in his
      ears when he tried to sleep? Beaten by his illegitimate son at the polls,
      the victim of his own wrong-doing&mdash;the sacrifice of penalty! He knew
      that his son, inheriting his own political gifts, had done what could have
      been done by no one else. All the years passed since Carnac was begotten
      laid their deathly hands upon him, and he knew he could never recover from
      this defeat. How much better it would have been if he had been struck
      twenty-seven years ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      Youth, ambition and resolve would have saved him from the worst then. Age
      has its powers, but it has its defects, and he had no hope that his own
      defects would be wiped out by luck at the polls. Spirit was gone out of
      him, longing for the future had no place in his mind; in the world of
      public work he was dead and buried. How little he had got from all his
      life! How few friends he had, and how few he was entitled to have! This is
      one of the punishments that selfishness and wrong-doing brings; it gives
      no insurance for the hours of defeat and loss. Well, wealth and power, the
      friends so needed in dark days, had not been made, and Barode Barouche
      realized he had naught left. He had been too successful from the start; he
      had had all his own way; and he had taken no pains to make or keep
      friends. He well knew there was no man in the Cabinet or among his
      colleagues that would stir to help him&mdash;he had stirred to help no man
      in all the years he had served the public. It was no good only to serve
      the public, for democracy is a weak stick on which to lean. One must stand
      by individuals or there is no defence against the malicious foes that
      follow the path of defeat, that ambush the way. It is the personal friends
      made in one&rsquo;s own good days that watch the path and clear away the
      ambushers. It is not big influential friends that are so important&mdash;the
      little unknown man may be as useful as the big boss in the mill of life;
      and if one stops to measure one&rsquo;s friends by their position, the end is no
      more sure than if one makes no friends at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing left for me in life&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo; he said as he
      tossed in bed while the thunder roared and the storm beat down the shrubs.
      &ldquo;How futile life is&mdash;&lsquo;Youth&rsquo;s a dream, middle age a delusion, old age
      a mistake!&rsquo;&rdquo; he kept repeating to himself in quotation. &ldquo;What does one get
      out of it? Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing! It&rsquo;s all a poor show at
      the best, and yet&mdash;is it? Is it all so bad? Is it all so poor and
      gaunt and hopeless? Isn&rsquo;t there anything in it for the man who gives and
      does his best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there came upon him the conviction that life is only futile to
      the futile, that it is only a failure to those who prove themselves
      incompetent, selfish and sordid; but to those who live life as it ought to
      be lived, there is no such thing as failure, or defeat, or penalty, or
      remorse or punishment. Because the straight man has only good ends to
      serve, he has no failures; though he may have disappointments, he has no
      defeats; for the true secret of life is to be content with what is
      decreed, to earn bread and make store only as conscience directs, and not
      to set one&rsquo;s heart on material things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out of bed soon after daylight, dressed, and went to the stable and
      hitched his horse to the buggy. The world was washed clean, that was sure.
      It was muddy under foot, but it was a country where the roads soon dried,
      and he would suffer little inconvenience from the storm. He bade his host
      good-bye and drove away intent to reach the city in time for breakfast. He
      found the roads heavy, and the injury of the storm was everywhere to be
      seen. Yet it all did not distract him, for he was thinking hard of the
      things that lay ahead of him to do&mdash;the heart-breaking things that
      his defeat meant to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he approached a bridge across a stream which had been badly swept
      by the storm. It was one of the covered bridges not uncommon in Canada. It
      was not long, as the river was narrow, and he did not see that the middle
      pier of the bridge had been badly injured. Yet as he entered the bridge,
      his horse still trotting, he was conscious of a hollow, semi-thunderous
      noise which seemed not to belong to the horse&rsquo;s hoofs and the iron wheels
      of the carriage. He raised his eyes to see that the other end of the
      bridge was clear, and at that moment he was conscious of an unsteady
      motion of the bridge, of a wavering of the roof, and then, before he had
      time to do aught, he saw the roof and the sides and the floor of the
      bridge collapse and sink slowly down.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry, he sprang from the carriage to retrace his way; but he only
      climbed up a ladder that grew every instant steeper; and all at once he
      was plunged downwards after his horse and carriage into the stream. He
      could swim, and as he swept down this thought came to him&mdash;that he
      might be able to get the shore, as he heard the cries of people on the
      bank. It was a hope that died at the moment of its birth, however, for he
      was struck by a falling timber on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, an hour later, he was found in an eddy of the river by the shore, he
      was dead, and his finders could only compose his limbs decently. But in
      the afternoon, the papers of Montreal had the following head-lines; DEFEAT
      AND DEATH OF BARODE BAROUCHE THE END OF A LONG AND GREAT CAREER
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Carnac Grier heard the news, he sent a note to his mother
      telling her all he knew. When she read the letter, she sank to the floor,
      overcome. Her son had triumphed indeed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. A WOMAN WRITES A LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The whole country rang with the defeat and death of Barode Barouche, and
      the triumph of the disinherited son of John Grier. Newspapers drew
      differing lessons from the event, but all admitted that Carnac, as a great
      fighter, was entitled to success. The Press were friendly to the memory of
      Barode Barouche, and some unduly praised his work, and only a few
      disparaged his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      When news of the tragedy came to Mrs. Grier, she was reading in the papers
      of Carnac&rsquo;s victory, and in her mind was an agonizing triumph, pride in a
      stern blow struck for punishment. The event was like none she could have
      imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment the note came from Carnac telling of Barouche&rsquo;s
      death, and it dropped from her hand to the floor. The horror of it smote
      her being, and, like one struck by lightning, she sank to the floor
      unconscious. The thing had hit her where soul and body were closely knit;
      and she had realized for the first time how we all must pay to the last
      penny for every offence we commit against the laws of life and nature.
      Barode Barouche had paid and she must pay&mdash;she also who had sinned
      with him must pay. But had she not paid?
    </p>
    <p>
      For long she lay unconscious, but at last the servant, unknowing why she
      was not called to remove the breakfast things, found her huddled on the
      floor, her face like that of death. The servant felt her heart, saw she
      was alive, and worked with her till consciousness came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, ma&rsquo;am, keep up heart. I&rsquo;ll send for M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Carnac at once,
      and we&rsquo;ll have you all right pretty quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Grier forbade Carnac to be sent for, and presently in her bed,
      declined to have the doctor brought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A doctor
      can do no good. I need rest, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she asked for notepaper and pen and ink, and so she was left alone.
      She must tell her beloved son why it was there never had been, and never
      could be, understanding between John Grier and himself. She had arrived at
      that point where naught was to be gained by further concealment. So
      through long hours she struggled with her problem, and she was glad Carnac
      did not come during the vexing day. He had said when he sent her word of
      his victory, that he feared he would not be able to see her the next day
      at all, as he had so much to do. She even declined to see Junia when she
      came, sending word that she was in bed, indisposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter she wrote ran thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   MY BELOVED CARNAC,

   Your news of the death of Barode Barouche has shocked me. You will
   understand when I tell you I have lived a life of agony ever since
   you became a candidate. This is why: you were fighting the man who
   gave you to the world.

   Let me tell you how. I loved John Grier when I married him, and
   longed to make my life fit in with his. But that could not easily
   be, for his life was wedded to his business, and he did not believe
   in women. To him they were incapable of the real business of life,
   and were only meant to be housekeepers to men who make the world go
   round. So, unintentionally, he neglected me, and I was young and
   comely then, so the world said, and I was unwise and thoughtless.

   Else, I should not have listened to Barode Barouche, who, one summer
   in camp on the St. Lawrence River near our camp, opened up for me
   new ways of thought, and springs of feeling. He had the gifts that
   have made you what you are, a figure that all turn twice to see. He
   had eloquence, he was thoughtful in all the little things which John
   Grier despised. In the solitude of the camp he wound himself about
   my life, and roused an emotion for him false to duty. And so one
   day&mdash;one single day, for never but the once was I weak, yet that was
   enough, God knows.... He went away because I would not see
   him again; because I would not repeat the offence which gave me
   years of sorrow and remorse.

   After you became a candidate, he came and offered to marry me, tried
   to reopen the old emotion; but I would have none of it. He was
   convinced he would defeat you, and he wanted to avoid fighting you.
   But when I said, &lsquo;Give up the seat to him,&rsquo; he froze. Of course,
   his seat belonged to his party and not alone to himself; but that
   was the test I put him to, and the answer he gave was, &lsquo;You want me
   to destroy my career in politics! That is your proposal, is it?&rsquo; 
   He was not honest either in life or conduct. I don&rsquo;t think he ever
   was sorry for me or for you, until perhaps these last few weeks; but
   I have sorrowed ever since the day you came to me very day, every
   hour, every minute; and the more because I could not tell John Grier
   the truth.

   Perhaps I ought to have told the truth long ago, and faced the
   consequences. It might seem now that I would have ruined my home
   life, and yours, and Barode Barouche&rsquo;s, and John Grier&rsquo;s life if I
   had told the truth; but who knows! There are many outcomes to
   life&rsquo;s tragedies, and none might have been what I fancied. It is
   little comfort that Barode Barouche has now given all for payment of
   his debt. It gives no peace of mind. And it may be you will think
   I ought not to tell you the truth. I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel you
   will not misunderstand. I tell you my story, so that you may again
   consider if it is not better to face the world with the truth about
   Luzanne. We can live but once, and it is to our good if we refuse
   the secret way. It is right you should know the truth about your
   birth, but it is not right you should declare it to all the world
   now. That was my duty long ago, and I did not do it. It is not
   your duty, and you must not do it. Barode Barouche is gone; John
   Grier has gone; and it would only hurt Fabian and his wife and you
   to tell it now. You inherit Barode Barouche&rsquo;s gifts, and you have
   his seat, you represent his people&mdash;and they are your people too.
   You have French blood in your veins, and you have a chance to carry
   on with honour what he did with skill. Forgive me, if you can.

               Your loving

                       MOTHER.

   P.S. Do nothing till you see me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. CARNAC AND HIS MOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Returning from Barode Barouche&rsquo;s home to his mother&rsquo;s House on the Hill,
      Carnac was in a cheerless mood. With Barouche&rsquo;s death to Carnac it was as
      though he himself had put aside for ever the armour of war, for Barouche
      was the only man in the world who had ever tempted him to fight, or whom
      he had fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing he must do: he must go to Junia, tell her he loved
      her, and ask her to be his wife. She had given him the fatal blue
      certificate of his marriage and the marriage could now be ended with
      Luzanne&rsquo;s consent, for she would not fight the divorce he must win soon.
      He could now tell the truth, if need be, to his constituents, for there
      would be time enough to recover his position, if it were endangered,
      before the next election came, and Junia would be by his side to help him!
      Junia&mdash;would she, after all, marry him now? He would soon know.
      To-night he must spend with his mother, but to-morrow he would see Junia
      and learn his fate, and know about Luzanne. Luzanne had been in Montreal,
      had been ready to destroy his chance at the polls, and Junia had stopped
      it. How? Well, he should soon know. But now, at first, for his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the House on the Hill, he had a sudden shiver. Somehow,
      the room where his mother had sat for so many years, and where he had last
      seen his father, John Grier, had a coldness of the tomb. There was a
      letter on the centre table standing against the lamp. He saw it was in his
      mother&rsquo;s handwriting, and addressed to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore it open, and began to read. Presently his cheeks turned pale. More
      than once he put it down, for it seemed impossible to go on, but with
      courage he took it up again and read on to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&mdash;God in Heaven!&rdquo; he broke out when he had finished it. For a
      long time he walked the floor, trembling in body and shaking in spirit.
      &ldquo;Now I understand everything,&rdquo; he said at last aloud in a husky tone. &ldquo;Now
      I see what I could not see&mdash;ah yes, I see at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For another time of silence and turmoil he paced the floor, then he
      stopped short. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they both are dead,&rdquo; he said wearily. Thinking of
      Barode Barouche, he had a great bitterness. &ldquo;To treat any woman so&mdash;how
      glad I am I fought him! He learned that such vile acts come home at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of John Grier. &ldquo;I loathed him and loved him always,&rdquo; he
      said with terrible remorse in his tone. &ldquo;He used my mother badly, and yet
      he was himself; he was the soul that he was born, a genius in his own way,
      a neglecter of all that makes life beautiful&mdash;and yet himself, always
      himself. He never pottered. He was real&mdash;a pirate, a plunderer, but
      he was real. And he cared for me, and would have had me in the business if
      he could. Perhaps John Grier knows the truth now!... I hope he does. For,
      if he does, he&rsquo;ll see that I was not to blame for what I did, that it was
      Fate behind me. He was a big man, and if I&rsquo;d worked with him, we&rsquo;d have
      done big things, bigger than he did, and that was big enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do nothing till you see me,&rdquo; his mother had written in a postscript to
      her letter, and, with a moroseness at his heart and scorn of Barouche at
      his lips, he went slowly up to his mother&rsquo;s room. At her door he paused.
      But the woman was his mother, and it must be faced. After all, she had
      kept faith ever since he was born. He believed that. She had been an
      honest wife ever since that fatal summer twenty-seven years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has suffered,&rdquo; he said, and knocked at her door. An instant later he
      was inside the room. There was only a dim light, but his mother was
      sitting up in her bed, a gaunt and yet beautiful, sad-eyed figure of a
      woman. For a moment Carnac paused. As he stood motionless, the face of the
      woman became more drawn and haggard, the eyes more deeply mournful. Her
      lips opened as though she would speak, but no sound came, and Carnac could
      hardly bear to look at her. Yet he did look, and all at once there rushed
      into his heart the love he had ever felt for her. After all, he was her
      son, and she had not wronged him since his birth. And he who had wronged
      her and himself was dead, his pathway closed for ever to the deeds of life
      and time. As he looked, his eyes filled with tears and his lips
      compressed. At last he came to the bed. Her letter was in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read it, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, but his face was good for her eyes to see. It had no
      hatred or repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know everything now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I see it all, and I understand all you
      have suffered these many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my son, you forgive your mother?&rdquo; She was trembling with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over and caught her wonderful head to his shoulder. &ldquo;I love you,
      mother,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I need you&mdash;need you more than I ever did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no heart any more, and I fear for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you fear for me? You wanted me to beat him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; His
      face grew hard, his lips became scornful. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the only way to make
      him settle his account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the only way. It was not that I fear for you in politics. I was sure
      you would win the election. It was not that, it was the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all finished. I am free at last,&rdquo; he said. He held the blue
      certificate before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was deadly pale, her eyes expanded, her breath came sharp and
      quick. &ldquo;How was it don how was it done? Was she here in Montreal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it was done, but she was here, and Junia got this from
      her. I shan&rsquo;t know how till I&rsquo;ve seen Junia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junia is the best friend,&rdquo; said the stricken woman gently, &ldquo;in all the
      world; she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so good a friend she must be told the truth,&rdquo; he said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not while I live! I could not bear that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I ask Junia to marry me and not tell her all the truth&mdash;mother,
      can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s face flushed scarlet. &ldquo;Ah, yes, I see, my boy&mdash;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we had enough of secrecy&mdash;in your letter you lamented it! If
      it was right for you to be secret all these years, is it not a hundred
      times right now for me to tell you the truth.... I have no name&mdash;no
      name,&rdquo; he added, tragedy in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my name. You may say I have no right to it, but it is the only
      name I can carry; they both are dead, and I must keep it. It wrongs no one
      living but you, and you have no hatred of me: you think I do not wrong you&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His cheek was hot with feeling. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
      still keep your married name.&rdquo; Then a great melancholy took hold of him,
      and he could hardly hide it from her. She saw how he was moved, and she
      tried to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Junia will resent it all?... But that isn&rsquo;t what a girl does
      when she loves. You have done no wrong; your hands are clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must tell her all. Tarboe is richer, he has an honest birth, he is
      a big man and will be bigger still. She likes him, she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will go to you without a penny, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be almost without a penny, if you don&rsquo;t live,&rdquo; he said with a
      faint smile. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t paint&mdash;for a time anyhow. I can&rsquo;t earn money
      for a time. I&rsquo;ve only my salary as a Member of Parliament and the little
      that&rsquo;s left of my legacy; therefore, I must draw on you. And I don&rsquo;t seem
      to mind drawing upon you; I never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled with an effort. &ldquo;If I can help you, I shall justify living on.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. TARBOE HAS A DREAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day Carnac was elected it was clear to Tarboe that he must win Junia
      at once, if he was ever to do so, for Carnac&rsquo;s new honours would play a
      great part in influencing her. In his mind, it was now or never for
      himself; he must bring affairs to a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia&rsquo;s father was poor, but the girl had given their home an air of
      comfort and an art belonging to larger spheres. The walls were covered
      with brown paper, and on it were a few of her own water-colour drawings,
      and a few old engravings of merit. Chintz was the cover on windows and
      easy chairs, and in a corner of the parlour was a chintz-covered lounge
      where she read of an evening. So it was that, with Carnac elected and
      Barode Barouche buried, she sat with one of Disraeli&rsquo;s novels in her hand
      busy with the future. She saw for Carnac a safe career, for his two chief
      foes were gone&mdash;Luzanne Larue and Barode Barouche. Now she understood
      why Carnac had never asked her to be his wife. She had had no word with
      Carnac since his election&mdash;only a letter to thank her for the
      marriage certificate and to say that after M. Barouche was buried he would
      come to her, if he might. He did say, however, in the letter that he owed
      her his election.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a great, big thing for me, dearest friend, and I am your ever
      grateful Carnac&rdquo;&mdash;that was the way he had put it. Twice she had gone
      to visit his mother, and had been told that Mrs. Grier was too ill to see
      her&mdash;overstrain, the servant had said. She could not understand being
      denied admittance; but it did not matter, for one day Mrs. Grier should
      know how she&mdash;Junia-had saved her son&rsquo;s career.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she thought, as she gazed before her into space from the chintz-covered
      lounge on the night of the day Barode Barouche was buried. There was a
      smell of roses in the room. She had gathered many of them that afternoon.
      She caught a bud from a bunch on a table, and fastened it in the bosom of
      her dress. Somehow, as she did it, she had a feeling she would like to
      clasp a man&rsquo;s head to her breast where the rose was&mdash;one of those
      wild thoughts that come to the sanest woman at times. She was captured by
      the excitement in which she had moved during the past month&mdash;far more
      now than she had been in all the fight itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a knock at the outer door, and before that of her own room
      opened, she recognized the step of the visitor. So it was Tarboe had come.
      He remembered that day in the street when he met Junia, and was shown
      there were times when a woman could not be approached with emotion. He had
      waited till the day he knew she was alone, for he had made a friend of her
      servant by judicious gifts of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re glad to see me,&rdquo; he said with an uncertain smile, as he saw
      her surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am,&rdquo; she replied, and motioned him to a seat. He chose a
      high-backed chair with a wide seat near the lounge. He made a motion of
      humorous dissent to her remark, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we pulled it off somehow, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Carnac Grier is
      M.P.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his foe is in his grave,&rdquo; remarked Tarboe dryly. &ldquo;Providence pays
      debts that ought to be paid. This election has settled a lot of things,&rdquo;
       she returned with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it has, and I&rsquo;ve come here to try and find one of the
      settlements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, find them,&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said one of the settlements only. I have to be accurate in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear of it. You helped Mr. Grier win his election. It was
      splendid of you. Think of it, Mr. Tarboe, Carnac Grier is beginning to get
      even with his foes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a foe&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what you mean. I&rsquo;ve proved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled provokingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve proved only you&rsquo;re not an absolute devil,
      that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ve not proved yourself a real man&mdash;not yet. Do you
      think it paid your debt to Carnac Grier that you helped get him into
      Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face became a little heated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove to you and to the world that
      I&rsquo;m not an absolute devil in the Grier interests. I didn&rsquo;t steal the
      property. I tried to induce John Grier to leave it to Carnac or his
      mother, for if he&rsquo;d left it to Mrs. Grier it would have come to Carnac. He
      did not do it that way, though. He left it to me. Was I to blame for
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, but you could have taken Carnac in, or given up the property
      to him&mdash;the rightful owner. You could have done that. But you were
      thinking of yourself altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether. In the first place, I am bound to keep my word to John
      Grier. Besides, if Carnac had inherited, the property would have got into
      difficulties&mdash;there were things only John Grier and I understood, and
      Carnac would have been floored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you still have been there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows! Who can tell! Maybe not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carnac Grier is a very able man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of the ablest. He&rsquo;ll be a success in Parliament. He&rsquo;ll play a big
      part; he won&rsquo;t puddle about. I meant there was a risk in letting Carnac
      run the business at the moment, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there never was with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. My mind had grasped all John Grier intended, and I have the
      business at my fingers&rsquo; ends. There was no risk with me. I&rsquo;ve proved it.
      I&rsquo;ve added five per cent to the value of the business since John Grier
      died. I can double the value of it in twenty years&mdash;and easy at
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you make up your mind to do it, you will,&rdquo; she said with admiration,
      for the man was persuasive, and he was playing a game in which he was a
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her remarks were alive with banter, for Tarboe&rsquo;s humour was a happiness to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I buy your approval?&rdquo; he questioned alertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By ability to put a bad case in a good light. You had your case, and you
      have made a real success. If you keep on you may become a Member of
      Parliament some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;Your gifts have their own way of stinging. I don&rsquo;t believe I
      could be elected to Parliament. I haven&rsquo;t the trick of popularity of that
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many thoughts flashed through Tarboe&rsquo;s mind. If he married her now, and
      the truth was told about the wills and the law gave Carnac his rights, she
      might hate him for not having told her when he proposed. So it was that in
      his desire for her life as his own, he now determined there should be no
      second will. In any case, Carnac had enough to live on through his mother.
      Also, he had capacity to support himself. There was a touch of
      ruthlessness in Tarboe. No one would ever guess what the second will
      contained&mdash;no one. The bank would have a letter saying where the will
      was to be found, but if it was not there!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would ask Junia to be his wife now, while she was so friendly. Her eyes
      were shining, her face was alive with feeling, and he was aware that the
      best chances of his life had come to win her. If she was not now in the
      hands of Carnac, his chances were good. Yet there was the tale of the
      secret marriage&mdash;the letter he saw Carnac receive in John Grier&rsquo;s
      office! The words of the ancient Greek came to him as he looked at her:
      &ldquo;He who will not strike when the hour comes shall wither like a flower,
      and his end be that of the chaff of the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face flushed with feeling, his eyes grew bright with longing, his
      tongue was loosed to the enterprise. &ldquo;Do you dream, and remember your
      dreams?&rdquo; he asked with a thrill in his voice. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dream often, but I sometimes remember my dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dream much, and one dream I have constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the capture of a wild bird in a garden&mdash;in a cultivated garden
      where there are no nests, no coverts for the secret invaders. I dream that
      I pursue the bird from flower-bed to flower-bed, from bush to bush, along
      paths and the green-covered walls; and I am not alone in my chase, for
      there are others pursuing. It is a bitter struggle to win the wild thing.
      And why? Because there is pursuing one of the pursuers another bird of red
      plumage. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and saw her face was full of colour and her eyes had a glow.
      Every nerve in her was pulsing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;whom do you mean by the bird of red
      plumage? Is it a mere figure of speech? Or has it a real meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has a real meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet, bent over her and spoke hotly. &ldquo;Junia, the end of my
      waiting has come. I want you as I never wanted anything in my life. I must
      know the truth. I love you, Junia. I have loved you from the first moment
      I saw you, and nothing is worth while with you not in it. Let us work
      together. It is a big, big game I&rsquo;m playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a big game you&rsquo;re playing,&rdquo; she said with emotion. &ldquo;It is a
      big, big game, and, all things considered, you should win it, but I doubt
      you will. I feel there are matters bigger than the game, or than you, or
      me, or anyone else. And I do not believe in your bird of red plumage; I
      don&rsquo;t believe it exists. It may have done so, but it doesn&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She also got to her feet, and Tarboe was so near her she could feel his
      hot breath on her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t exist now,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and the pursuer is not pursued.
      You have more imagination than belongs to a mere man of business&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      an inexperienced poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hand and drew it to his breast. &ldquo;The only poetry I know is
      the sound of your voice in the wind, the laughter of your lips in the sun,
      the delight of your body in the heavenly flowers. Yes, I&rsquo;ve drunk you in
      the wild woods; I&rsquo;ve trailed you on the river; I&rsquo;ve heard you in the
      grinding storm&mdash;always the same, the soul of all beautiful things.
      Junia, you shall not put me away from you. You shall be mine, and you and
      I together shall win our way to great ends. We will have opportunity,
      health, wealth and prosperity. Isn&rsquo;t it worth while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered after a moment, &ldquo;but it cannot be with you, my
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her fingers and stepped back; she made a gesture of friendly
      repulsion. &ldquo;You have said all that can be said, you have gifts greater
      than you yourself believe; and I have been tempted; but it is no use,
      there are deeper things than luxuries and the magazines of merchandise&mdash;much
      deeper. No, no, I cannot marry you; if you were as rich as Midas, as
      powerful as Caesar, I would not marry you&mdash;never, never, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love another,&rdquo; he said boldly. &ldquo;You love Carnac Grier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not love you&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost&mdash;almost enough,&rdquo; he said, embarrassed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. THIS WAY HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      All Junia had ever felt of the soul of things was upon her as she arranged
      flowers and listened to the church bells ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to be always ringing,&rdquo; she said to herself, as she lightly
      touched the roses. &ldquo;It must be a Saint&rsquo;s Day&mdash;where&rsquo;s Denzil? Ah,
      there he is in the garden! I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truth is, she was deceiving herself. She wanted to talk with Denzil about
      all that had happened of late, and he seemed, somehow, to avoid her.
      Perhaps he feared she had given her promise to Tarboe who had, as Denzil
      knew, spent an hour with her the night before. As this came to Denzil&rsquo;s
      brain, he felt a shiver go through him. Just then he heard Junia&rsquo;s
      footsteps, and saw her coming towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are the bells ringing so much, Denzil? Is it a Saint&rsquo;s Day?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat. &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle, it is a Saint&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; and he named
      it. &ldquo;There were lots of neighbours at early Mass, and some have gone to
      the Church of St. Anne de Beaupre at Beaupre, them that&rsquo;s got sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Beaupre is as good as Lourdes, I&rsquo;m sure. Why didn&rsquo;t you go, Denzil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I go, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t sick&mdash;ah, bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were. You&rsquo;ve been in low spirits ever since our election,
      Denzil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing strange in that, ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of him that&rsquo;s
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Monsieur Barouche, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Barouche, but of the father to the man that beat M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; 
      Barouche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be thinking so much of John Grier these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the right time? His son that he threw off without a penny has
      proved himself as big a man as his father&mdash;ah, surelee! M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; left
      behind him a will that gave all he had to a stranger. His own son was left
      without a sou. There he is now,&rdquo; he added, nodding towards the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junia saw Carnac making his way towards her house. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll talk with
      him,&rdquo; she said, and her face flushed. She knew she must give account of
      her doings with Luzanne Larue.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later in the house, her hand lay in that of Carnac, and his
      eyes met hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all come our way, Junia,&rdquo; he remarked gaily, though there was
      sadness in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as you wanted it. You won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to you, Junia,&rdquo; and he took from his pocket the blue certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;oh, that was not easy to get,&rdquo; she said with agitation. &ldquo;She
      had a bad purpose, that girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She meant to announce it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, through Barode Barouche. He agreed to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac flushed. &ldquo;He agreed to that&mdash;you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The day you were made candidate she arrived here; and the next
      morning she went to Barode Barouche and told her story. He bade her remain
      secret till the time was ripe, and he was to be the judge of that. He was
      waiting for the night before the election. Then he was going to strike you
      and win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told you that&mdash;Luzanne told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And much else. Besides, she told me you had saved her life from the
      street-cars; that you had played fair at the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First and last I played fair,&rdquo; he said indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were shining. &ldquo;Not from first to last, Carnac. You ought not to
      have painted her, or made much of her and then thrown her over. She knew&mdash;of
      course she knew, after a time, that you did not mean to propose to her,
      and all the evil in her came out. Then she willed to have you in spite of
      yourself, believing, if you were married, her affection would win you in
      the end. There it was&mdash;and you were to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you defend her, Junia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tongue became bitter now. &ldquo;Just as you would, if it was some one else
      and not yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head was sunk on his breast, his eyes were burning. &ldquo;It was a horrible
      thing for Barouche to plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so horrible? If you were hiding a marriage for whatever reason, it
      should be known to all whose votes you wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barouche was the last man on earth to challenge me, for he had a most
      terrible secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Her voice had alarm, for she had never seen Carnac so
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was fighting his own son&mdash;and he knew it!&rdquo; The words came in
      broken accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was fighting his own son, and he knew it! You mean to say that!&rdquo;
       Horror was in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that the summer before I was born&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told her the story as his mother had told it to him. Then at last he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you know Barode Barouche got what he deserved. He ruined my
      mother&rsquo;s life; he died the easiest death such a man could die. He has also
      spoiled my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can spoil your life except yourself,&rdquo; she declared firmly, and
      she laid a hand upon his arm. &ldquo;Who told you all this&mdash;and when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother in a letter last night. I had a talk with her afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want you to know why our ways must for ever lie apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t grasp what you mean,&rdquo; she declared in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t grasp why, loving you, I didn&rsquo;t ask you to marry me long ago;
      but you found out for yourself from the one who was responsible, and freed
      me and saved me; and now you know I am an illegitimate son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want to cut me out of your life for a bad man&rsquo;s crime, not your
      own.... Listen, Carnac. Last night I told Mr. Tarboe I could not marry
      him. He is rich, he has control of a great business, he is a man of mark.
      Why do you suppose I did it, and for over two years have done the same?&mdash;for
      he has wanted me all that time. Does not a girl know when a real man wants
      her? And Luke Tarboe is a real man. He knows what he wants, and he goes
      for it, and little could stop him as he travels. Why do you suppose I did
      it?&rdquo; Her face flushed, anger lit her eyes. &ldquo;Because there was another man;
      but I&rsquo;ve only just discovered he&rsquo;s a sham, with no real love for me. It
      makes me sorry I ever knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me&mdash;no real love for you! That&rsquo;s not the truth: it&rsquo;s because I have
      no real name to give you&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve spoken as I have. Never
      have I cared for anyone except you, Junia, and I could have killed anyone
      that wronged you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill yourself then,&rdquo; she flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I wronged you, Junia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you kept me waiting and prevented me from marrying a man I could have
      loved, if I hated you&mdash;if you did that, and then at last told me to
      go my ways, don&rsquo;t you think it wronging me! Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Carnac.
      You&rsquo;re not the only man on earth a good girl could love. I tell you, again
      and again I have been moved towards Luke Tarboe, and if he had had
      understanding of women, I should now be his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me what I have always known,&rdquo; he interposed. &ldquo;I knew Tarboe had
      a hold on your heart. I&rsquo;m not so vain as to think I&rsquo;ve always been the one
      man for you. I lived long in anxious fear, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you shut the door in my face! Looked at from any standpoint, it&rsquo;s
      ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to have your due,&rdquo; he answered with face paler. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
      great woman&mdash;the very greatest, and should have a husband born in
      honest wedlock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best judge of what I want,&rdquo; she declared almost sharply, yet
      there was a smile at her lips. &ldquo;Why, I suppose if John Grier had left you
      his fortune, you&rsquo;d give it up; you&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;I have no right to it,&rsquo; and
      would give it to my brother-in-law, Fabian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet Fabian had all he deserved from his father. He has all he should
      have, and he tried to beat his father in business. Carnac, don&rsquo;t be a
      bigger fool than there&rsquo;s any need to be. What is better than that John
      Grier&rsquo;s business should be in Tarboe&rsquo;s hands&mdash;or in yours? Remember,
      John Grier might have left it all to your mother, and, if he had, you&rsquo;d
      have taken it, if she had left it to you. You&rsquo;d have taken it even if you
      meant to give it away afterwards. There are hospitals to build. There are
      good and costly things to do for the State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she saw in his eyes a curious soft understanding, and she put her
      hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Carnac,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;great, great Carnac,
      won&rsquo;t you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant he felt he must still put her from him, then he clasped her
      to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I really had to throw myself into your arms!&rdquo; she said later.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &ldquo;HALVES, PARDNER, HALVES&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      It was Thanksgiving Day, and all the people of the Province were en fete.
      The day was clear, and the air was thrilling with the spirits of the north
      country; the vibrant sting of oxygen, the blessed resilience of the river
      and the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great day on the St. Lawrence, for men were preparing to go to
      the backwoods, to the &ldquo;shanties,&rdquo; and hosts were busy with the crops,
      storing them; while all in trade and industry were cheerful. There was a
      real benedicite in the air. In every church. Catholic and Protestant,
      hands of devoted workers had made beautiful altar and communion table, and
      lectern and pulpit, and in the Methodist chapel and the Presbyterian kirk,
      women had made the bare interiors ornate. The bells of all the churches
      were ringing, French and English; and each priest, clergyman and minister
      was moving his people in his own way and by his own ritual to bless God
      and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the city itself, the Mayor had arranged a festival in the evening, and
      there were gathered many people to give thanks. But those most conspicuous
      were the poor, unsophisticated habitants, who were on good terms with the
      refreshment provided. Their enthusiasm was partly due to the presence of
      Carnac Grier. In his speech to the great crowd, among other things the
      Mayor said: &ldquo;It is our happiness that we have here one whose name is
      familiar to all in French-Canada&mdash;that of the new Member of
      Parliament, Monsieur Carnac Grier. In Monsieur Grier we have a man who
      knows his own mind, and it is filled with the interests of the French as
      well as the English. He is young, he has power, and he will use his youth
      and power to advance the good of the whole country. May he live long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac never spoke better in his life than in his brief reply. When he had
      finished, some one touched his arm. It was Luke Tarboe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good speech, Grier. Can you give me a few moments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; asked Carnac, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here, but in the building. There is a room where we can be alone, and
      I have to tell you something of great importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of great importance? Well, so have I to tell you, Tarboe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later they were in the Mayor&rsquo;s private parlour, hung with
      the portraits of past Governors and Mayors, and carrying over the door the
      coat-of-arms of the Province.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Carnac said: &ldquo;Let me give you my news first, Tarboe: I am to
      marry Junia Shale&mdash;and soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe nodded. &ldquo;I expected that. She is worth the best the world can
      offer.&rdquo; There was a ring of honesty in his tone. &ldquo;All the more reason why
      I should tell you what my news is, Carnac. I&rsquo;m going to tell you what
      oughtn&rsquo;t yet to be told for another two years, but I feel it due you, for
      you were badly used, and so I break my word to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac&rsquo;s hand shot out in protest, but Tarboe took no notice. &ldquo;I mean to
      tell you now in the hour of your political triumph that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can draw on you for ten thousand dollars, perhaps?&rdquo; shot out
      Carnac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for ten thousand, but in two years&rsquo; time&mdash;or to-morrow&mdash;for
      a hundred and fifty times that if you want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re driving at,
      Tarboe. Two years from now&mdash;or to-morrow&mdash;I can draw on you for
      a hundred and fifty times ten thousand dollars! What does that mean? Is it
      you&rsquo;re tired of the fortune left you by the biggest man industrially
      French-Canada has ever known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth&mdash;I never had a permanent fortune, and I was
      never meant to have the permanent fortune, though I inherited by will.
      That was a matter between John Grier and myself. There was another will
      made later, which left the business to some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t see, and yet you must.&rdquo; Tarboe then told the story of
      the making of the two wills, doing justice to John Grier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never did things like anyone else, and he didn&rsquo;t in dying. He loved
      you, Carnac. In spite of all he said and did he believed in you. He knew
      you had the real thing in you, if you cared to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Good God!&rdquo; was all Carnac could at first say. &ldquo;And you agreed
      to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rights had I? None at all. I&rsquo;ll come out of it with over a
      half-million dollars&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that enough for a backwoodsman? I get the
      profits of the working for three years, and two hundred thousand dollars
      besides. I ought to be satisfied with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows of the will besides yourself?&rdquo; asked Carnac sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one. There is a letter to the bank simply saying that another will
      exists and where it is, but that&rsquo;s all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you could have destroyed that will in my favour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; The voice of Tarboe was rough with feeling, his face grew
      dark. &ldquo;More than once I willed to destroy it. It seemed at first I could
      make better use of the property than you. The temptation was big, but I
      held my own, and now I&rsquo;ve no fear of meeting anyone in Heaven or Hell.
      I&rsquo;ve told you all....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite all. There&rsquo;s one thing more. The thought of Junia Shale made me
      want to burn the second will, and I almost did it; but I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had, and had married her, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been happy. You can&rsquo;t
      be fooling a wife and be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I know that&mdash;just in time.... I have a bad heart, Carnac.
      Your property came to me against my will through your father, but I wanted
      the girl you&rsquo;re going to marry, and against my will you won her. I fought
      for her. I thought there was a chance for me, because of the rumour you
      were secretly married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about it, Tarboe, now. It was an ugly business.&rdquo; And he
      told in a dozen sentences the story of Luzanne and the false marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished, Tarboe held out his hand. &ldquo;It was a close shave,
      Carnac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few further remarks, Tarboe said: &ldquo;I thought there was a chance
      for me with Junia Shale, but there never was a real one, for she was yours
      from a child. You won her fairly, Carnac. If you&rsquo;ll come to the office
      to-morrow morning, I&rsquo;ll show you the will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll show me the will?&rdquo; asked Carnac with an edge to his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Tarboe did not like the look in the other&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, what you have you shall keep, and what John Grier leaves me by
      that will, I will not keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will inherit, and you shall keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And turn you out!&rdquo; remarked Carnac ironically. &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t be turned out.
      I hoped you&rsquo;d keep me as manager. Few could do it as well, and, as Member
      of Parliament, you haven&rsquo;t time yourself. I&rsquo;ll stay as manager at twenty
      thousand dollars a year, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carnac could not tell him the real reason for declining to inherit, but
      that did not matter. Yet there flashed into his heart a love, which he had
      never felt so far in his life, for John Grier. The old man had believed he
      would come out right in the end, and so had left him the fortune in so odd
      a way. How Carnac longed to tell Tarboe the whole truth about Barode
      Barouche, and yet dare not! After a short time of hesitation and doubt,
      Carnac said firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by the will, if you&rsquo;ll be my partner and manager, Tarboe. If
      you&rsquo;ll take half the business and manage the whole of it, I&rsquo;ll sell the
      half for a dollar to you, and we can run together to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarboe&rsquo;s face lighted; there was triumph in his eyes. It was all better
      than he had dared to hope, for he liked the business, and he loathed the
      way the world had looked at John Grier&rsquo;s will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halves, pardner, halves!&rdquo; he said, assenting gladly, and held out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They clasped hands warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Junia appeared. She studied their faces anxiously.
      When she saw the smiling light in them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you two good men!&rdquo; she said joyously, and held out a hand to each.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
