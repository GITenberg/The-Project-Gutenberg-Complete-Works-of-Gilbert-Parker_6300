      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of them, Molly?&rdquo; said Sir Duke Lawless to his
      wife, his eyes resting with some amusement on a big man and a little one
      talking to Lord Hampstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little man is affected, gauche, and servile. The big one picturesque
      and superior in a raw kind of way. He wishes to be rude to some one, and
      is disappointed because, just at the moment, Lord Hampstead is too polite
      to give him his cue. A dangerous person in a drawing-room, I should think;
      but interesting. You are a bold man to bring them here, Duke. Is it not
      awkward for our host?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hampstead did it with his eyes open. Besides, there is business behind it&mdash;railways,
      mines, and all that; and Hampstead&rsquo;s nephew is going to the States
      fortune-hunting. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless lifted her eyebrows. &ldquo;&lsquo;To what base uses are we come,
      Horatio!&rsquo; You invite me to dinner and&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fix things up right.&rsquo; 
      That is the proper phrase, for I have heard you use it. Status for
      dollars. Isn&rsquo;t it low? I know you do not mean what you say, Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s eyes were playing on the men with a puzzled expression, as
      though trying to read the subject of their conversation; and he did not
      reply immediately. Soon, however, he turned and looked down at his wife
      genially, and said: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s about it, I suppose. But really there is
      nothing unusual in this, so far as Mr. John Vandewaters is concerned, for
      in his own country he travels &lsquo;the parlours of the Four Hundred,&rsquo; and is
      considered &lsquo;a very elegant gentleman.&rsquo; We must respect a man according to
      the place he holds in his own community. Besides, as you suggest, Mr.
      Vandewaters is interesting. I might go further, and say that he is a very
      good fellow indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be asking him down to Craigruie next,&rdquo; said Lady Lawless,
      inquisition in her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I mean to do, with your permission, my dear. I hope
      to see him laying about among the grouse in due season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Duke, you are painfully Bohemian. I can remember when you were
      perfectly precise and exclusive, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful prig I must have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt. That was before you went aroving in savage countries,
      and picked up all sorts of acquaintances, making friends with the most
      impossible folk. I should never be surprised to see you drive Shon McGann&mdash;and
      his wife, of course&mdash;and Pretty Pierre&mdash;with some other man&rsquo;s
      wife&mdash;up to the door in a dogcart; their clothes in a saddle-bag, or
      something less reputable, to stay a month. Duke, you have lost your
      decorum; you are a gipsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear Shon McGann and Pierre wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy being with us as I should
      enjoy having them. You can never understand what a life that is out in
      Pierre&rsquo;s country. If it weren&rsquo;t for you and the bairn, I should be off
      there now. There is something of primeval man in me. I am never so healthy
      and happy, when away from you, as in prowling round the outposts of
      civilisation, and living on beans and bear&rsquo;s meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched to his feet, and his wife rose with him. There was a fine
      colour on his cheek, and his eye had a pleasant fiery energy. His wife
      tapped him on the arm with her fan. She understood him very well, though
      pretending otherwise. &ldquo;Duke, you are incorrigible. I am in daily dread of
      your starting off in the middle of the night, leaving me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watering your couch with your tears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and hearing nothing more from you till a cable from Quebec or
      Winnipeg tells me that you are on your way to the Arctic Circle with
      Pierre or some other heathen. But, seriously, where did you meet Mr.
      Vandewaters&mdash;Heavens, what a name!&mdash;and that other person? And
      what is the other person&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other person carries the contradictory name of Stephen Pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he continually finger his face, and show his emotions so? He
      assents to everything said to him by an appreciative exercise of his
      features.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you ask a great and solemn question. Let me introduce the young
      man, that you may get your answer at the fountain-head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, Duke. Sit down and tell me when and where you met these
      men, and why you have continued the acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; he said, obeying her, &ldquo;you are a terrible inquisitor, and the
      privacy of one&rsquo;s chamber were the kinder place to call one to account. But
      I bend to your implacability.... Mr. Vandewaters, like myself, has a taste
      for roving, though our aims are not identical. He has a fine faculty for
      uniting business and pleasure. He is not a thorough sportsman&mdash;there
      is always a certain amount of enthusiasm, even in the unrewarded patience
      of the true hunter; but he sufficeth. Well, Mr. Vandewaters had been
      hunting in the far north, and looking after a promising mine at the same
      time. He was on his way south at one angle, I at another angle, bound for
      the same point. Shon McGann was with me; Pierre with Vandewaters. McGann
      left me, at a certain point, to join his wife at a Barracks of the Riders
      of the Plains. I had about a hundred miles to travel alone. Well, I got
      along the first fifty all right. Then came trouble. In a bad place of the
      hills I fell and broke an ankle bone. I had an Eskimo dog of the right
      sort with me. I wrote a line on a bit of birch bark, tied it round his
      neck, and started him away, trusting my luck that he would pull up
      somewhere. He did. He ran into Vandewaters&rsquo;s camp that evening.
      Vandewaters and Pierre started away at once. They had dogs, and reached me
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the first time I had seen Pierre for years. They fixed me up, and
      we started south. And that&rsquo;s as it was in the beginning with Mr. John
      Vandewaters and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless had been watching the two strangers during the talk, though
      once or twice she turned and looked at her husband admiringly. When he had
      finished she said: &ldquo;That is very striking. What a pity it is that men we
      want to like spoil all by their lack of form!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure about Vandewaters. Does he look flurried by these
      surroundings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He certainly has an air of contentment. It is, I suppose, the usual
      air of self-made Americans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to London, E.C., and you will find the same, plus smugness. Now, Mr.
      Vandewaters has real power&mdash;and taste too, as you will see. Would you
      think Mr. Stephen Pride a self-made man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think of any one else who would be proud of the patent. Please
      to consider the seals about his waistcoat, and the lady-like droop of his
      shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet he is thought to be a young man of parts. He has money, made by his
      ancestors; he has been round the world; he belongs to societies for
      culture and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will rave of the Poet&rsquo;s Corner, ask if one likes Pippa Passes, and
      expect to be introduced to every woman in the room at a tea-party, to say
      nothing of proposing impossible things, such as taking one&rsquo;s girl friends
      to the opera alone, sending them boxes of confectionery, and writing them
      dreadfully reverential notes at the same time. Duke, the creature is
      impossible, believe me. Never, never, if you love me, invite him to
      Craigruie. I met one of his tribe at Lady Macintyre&rsquo;s when I was just out
      of school; and at the dinner-table, when the wine went round, he lifted
      his voice and asked for a cup of tea, saying he never &lsquo;drank.&rsquo; Actually he
      did, Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband laughed quietly. He had a man&rsquo;s enjoyment of a woman&rsquo;s dislike
      of bad form. &ldquo;A common criminal man, Molly. Tell me, which is the greater
      crime: to rob a bank or use a fish-knife for asparagus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless fanned herself. &ldquo;Duke, you make me hot. But if you will have
      the truth: the fish-knife business by all means. Nobody need feel
      uncomfortable about the burglary, except the burglar; but see what a
      position for the other person&rsquo;s hostess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, women have no civic virtues. Their credo is, &lsquo;I believe in
      beauty and fine linen, and the thing that is not gauche.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was smiling. &ldquo;Well, have it your own way. It is a creed of
      comfort, at any rate. And now, Duke, if I must meet the man of mines and
      railways and the spare person making faces at Lord Hampstead, let it be
      soon, that it may be done with; and pray don&rsquo;t invite them to Craigruie
      till I have a chance to speak with you again. I will not have impossible
      people at a house-party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a difficult fellow your husband is, Molly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difficult; but perfectly possible. His one fault is a universal sympathy
      which shines alike on the elect&mdash;and the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. Well, this is our dance. After it is over, prepare for the
      Americanos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later Mr. Vandewaters was standing in a conspicuous corner
      talking to Lady Lawless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, then, your first visit to England?&rdquo; she asked. He had a dry,
      deliberate voice, unlike the smooth, conventional voices round him. &ldquo;Yes,
      Lady Lawless,&rdquo; he replied: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve put my foot in London
      town, and&mdash;perhaps you won&rsquo;t believe it of an American&mdash;I find
      it doesn&rsquo;t take up a very conspicuous place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The humour was slightly accentuated, and Lady Lawless shrank a little, as
      if she feared the depths of divertisement to which this speech might lead;
      but a quick look at the man assured her of his common-sense, and she
      answered: &ldquo;It is of the joys of London that no one is so important but
      finds the space he fills a small one, which may be filled acceptably by
      some one else at any moment. It is easy for kings and princes even&mdash;we
      have secluded princes here now&mdash;to get lost and forgotten in London.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Well, that leaves little chance for ordinary Americans, who don&rsquo;t bank on
      titles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, puzzled in spite of herself. But she presently said, with
      frankness and naivete: &ldquo;What does &lsquo;bank on titles&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stroked his beard, smiling quaintly, and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to put
      the thing better-it seems to fill the bill. But, anyway, Americans are
      republicans; and don&rsquo;t believe in titles, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, pardon me,&rdquo; she interrupted: &ldquo;of course, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got little ways of talking not the same as yours. You don&rsquo;t seem to
      have the snap to conversation that we have in the States. But I&rsquo;ll say
      here that I think you have got a better style of talking. It isn&rsquo;t
      exhausting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pride said to me a moment ago that they spoke better English in
      Boston than any other place in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he, though, Lady Lawless? That&rsquo;s good. Well, I guess he was only
      talking through his hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly amused. Her first impressions were correct. The man was
      interesting. He had a quaint, practical mind. He had been thrown upon his
      own resources, since infancy almost, in a new country; and he had seen
      with his own eyes, nakedly, and without predisposition or instruction.
      From childhood thoroughly adaptable, he could get into touch with things
      quickly, and instantly like or dislike them. He had been used to approach
      great concerns with fearlessness and competency. He respected a thing only
      for its real value, and its intrinsic value was as clear to him as the
      market value. He had, perhaps, an exaggerated belief in the greatness of
      his own country, because he liked eagerness and energy and daring. The
      friction and hurry of American life added to his enjoyment. They acted on
      him like a stimulating air, in which he was always bold, collected, and
      steady. He felt an exhilaration in being superior to the rustle of forces
      round him. It had been his habit to play the great game of business with
      decision and adroitness. He had not spared his opponent in the fight; he
      had crushed where his interests were in peril and the sport played into
      his hands; comforting himself, if he thought of the thing, with the
      knowledge that he himself would have been crushed if the other man had
      not. He had never been wilfully unfair, nor had he used dishonourable
      means to secure his ends: his name stood high in his own country for
      commercial integrity; men said: he &ldquo;played square.&rdquo; He had, maybe, too
      keen a contempt for dulness and incompetency in enterprise, and he loathed
      red-tape; but this was racial. His mind was as open as his manners. He was
      utterly approachable. He was a millionaire, and yet in his own offices in
      New York he was as accessible as a President. He handled things without
      gloves, and this was not a good thing for any that came to him with a weak
      case. He had a penetrating intelligence; and few men attempted, after
      their first sophistical statements, to impose upon him: he sent them away
      unhappy. He did not like England altogether: first, because it lacked, as
      he said, enterprise; and because the formality, decorum and excessive
      convention fretted him. He saw that in many things the old land was
      backward, and he thought that precious time was being wasted. Still, he
      could see that there were things, purely social, in which the Londoners
      were at advantage; and he acknowledged this when he said, concerning
      Stephen Pride&rsquo;s fond boast, that he was &ldquo;talking through his hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless smiled, and after a moment rejoined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it mean that he was mumming, as it were, like a conjurer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. You are pretty smart, Lady Lawless; for I can see that, from
      your stand-point, it isn&rsquo;t always easy to catch the meaning of sayings
      like that. But they do hit the case, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They give a good deal of individuality to conversation,&rdquo; was the vague
      reply. &ldquo;What, do you think, is the chief lack in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerve and enterprise. But I&rsquo;m not going to say you ought to have the same
      kind of nerve as ours. We are a different tribe, with different
      surroundings, and we don&rsquo;t sit in the same kind of saddle. We ride for all
      we&rsquo;re worth all the time. You sit back and take it easy. We are never
      satisfied unless we are behind a fast trotter; you are content with a good
      cob that steps high, tosses its head, and has an aristocratic stride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been in the country much?&rdquo; she asked, without any seeming
      relevancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was keen enough. He saw the veiled point of her question. &ldquo;No: I&rsquo;ve
      never been in the country here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose you mean that I don&rsquo;t
      see or know England till I&rsquo;ve lived there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Mr. Vandewaters.&rdquo; She smiled to think what an undistinguished
      name it was. It suggested pumpkins in the front garden. Yet here its owner
      was perfectly at his ease, watching the scene before him with good-natured
      superiority. &ldquo;London is English; but it is very cosmopolitan, you know,&rdquo;
       she added; &ldquo;and I fancy you can see it is not a place for fast trotters.
      The Park would be too crowded for that&mdash;even if one wished to drive a
      Maud S.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his slow keen eyes on her, and a smile broadened into a low
      laugh, out of which he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of Maud S? I didn&rsquo;t think you would be up in racing
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that my husband is a traveller, and an admirer of Americans
      and things American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and a staving good traveller he is. You don&rsquo;t
      catch him asleep, I can tell you, Lady Lawless. He has stuff in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stuff to make a good American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; with something over. He&rsquo;s the kind of Englishman that can keep cool
      when things are ticklish, and look as if he was in a parlour all the time.
      Americans keep cool, but look cheeky. O, I know that. We square our
      shoulders and turn out our toes, and push our hands into our pockets, and
      act as if we owned the world. Hello&mdash;by Jingo!&rdquo; Then, apologetically:
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Lady Lawless; it slipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless followed Mr. Vandewaters&rsquo;s glance, and saw, passing on her
      husband&rsquo;s arm, a tall, fascinating girl. She smiled meaningly to herself,
      as she sent a quick quizzical look at the American, and said, purposely
      misinterpreting his exclamation: &ldquo;I am not envious, Mr. Vandewaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. That&rsquo;s a commoner thing with us than with you. American
      girls get more notice and attention from their cradles up, and they want
      it all along the line. You see, we&rsquo;ve mostly got the idea that an
      Englishman expects from his wife what an American woman expects from her
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do Americans get these impressions about us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From our newspapers, I guess; and the newspapers take as the ground-work
      of their belief the Bow Street cases where Englishmen are cornered for
      beating their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we were to judge of American Society by the cases in a Chicago
      Divorce Court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have me on toast. That&rsquo;s what comes of having a husband who
      takes American papers. Mind you, I haven&rsquo;t any idea that the American
      papers are right. I&rsquo;ve had a lot to do with newspapers, and they are
      pretty ignorant, I can tell you&mdash;cheap all round. What&rsquo;s a newspaper,
      anyway, but an editor, more or less smart and overworked, with an owner
      behind him who has got some game on hand? I know: I&rsquo;ve been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How have you &lsquo;been there&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve owned four big papers all at once, and had fifty others under my
      thumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless caught her breath; but she believed him. &ldquo;You must be very
      rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owning newspapers doesn&rsquo;t mean riches. It&rsquo;s a lever, though, for tipping
      the dollars your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they have&mdash;tipped your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: pretty well. But, don&rsquo;t follow this lead any farther, Lady Lawless,
      or you may come across something that will give you a start. I should like
      to keep on speaking terms with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that a man cannot hold fifty newspapers under his thumb, and
      live in the glare of a search-light also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. You can&rsquo;t make millions without pulling wires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw him watching the girl on her husband&rsquo;s arm. She had the instinct
      of her sex. She glanced at the stately girl again; then at Mr. Vandewaters
      critically, and rejoined, quizzically: &ldquo;Did you&mdash;make millions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes still watching, he replied abstractedly. &ldquo;Yes: a few handfuls,
      and lost a few&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get them back on the London market?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not come in vain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could tell you better in a month or so from now. In any case, I don&rsquo;t
      stand to lose. I&rsquo;ve come to take things away from England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will take away a good opinion of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;d been any doubt of it half an hour ago, it would be all gone
      this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is nice of you; and not in your usual vein, I should think. But,
      Mr. Vandewaters, we want you to come to Craigruie, our country place, to
      spend a week. Then you will have a chance to judge us better, or rather
      more broadly and effectively.&rdquo; She was looking at the girl, and at that
      moment she caught Sir Duke&rsquo;s eye. She telegraphed to him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Lady Lawless, I&rsquo;m glad you have asked me. But&mdash;&rdquo; He
      glanced to where Mr. Pride was being introduced to the young lady on Sir
      Duke&rsquo;s arm, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are hoping,&rdquo; she added, interpreting his thought, and speaking a
      little dryly, &ldquo;that your friend, Mr. Stephen Pride&rdquo;&mdash;the name sounded
      so ludicrous&mdash;&ldquo;will join us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be proud enough, you may be sure. It&rsquo;s a singular combination,
      Pride and myself, isn&rsquo;t it? But, you see, he has a fortune which, as yet,
      he has never been able to handle for himself; and I do it for him. We are
      partners, and, though you mightn&rsquo;t think it, he has got more money now
      than when he put his dollars at my disposal to help me make a few millions
      at a critical time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless let her fan touch Mr. Vandewaters&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I am going to do
      you a great favour. You see that young lady coming to us with my husband?
      Well, I am going to introduce you to her. It is such as she&mdash;such
      women&mdash;who will convince you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that you have yet to make your&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;Ah,
      I have it: your &lsquo;biggest deal,&rsquo;&mdash;and, in truth, your best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; rejoined Vandewaters musingly. &ldquo;Is that so? I always thought
      I&rsquo;d make my biggest deal in the States. Who is she? She is handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is more than handsome, and she is the Honourable Gracia Raglan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand about &lsquo;The Honourable.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain that another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Miss Raglan, in a gentle bewilderment, walked down the
      ballroom on the arm of the millionaire, half afraid that something gauche
      would happen; but by the time she had got to the other end was reassured,
      and became interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke said to his wife in an aside, before he left her with Mr.
      Vandewaters&rsquo;s financial partner: &ldquo;What is your pretty conspiracy, Molly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do talk English, Duke, and do not interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later, on the way home, Sir Duke said: &ldquo;You asked Mr. Pride
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I grieve to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why grieve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because his experiences with us seem to make him dizzy. He will be
      terribly in earnest with every woman in the house, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not keep him in line yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. And the creature is not even interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast your eye about. He has millions; you have cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mean that, Duke? I would see them in their graves first. He
      says &lsquo;My lady&rsquo; every other sentence, and wants to send me flowers, and a
      box for the opera, and to drive me in the Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my life he can&rsquo;t ride. You will have him
      about the place like a tame cat.&rdquo; Then, seeing that his wife was annoyed:
      &ldquo;Never mind, Molly, I will help you all I can. I want to be kind to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you do. But what is your &lsquo;pretty conspiracy,&rsquo; Duke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A well-stocked ranche in Colorado.&rdquo; He did not mean it. And she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be so mercenary?&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they both laughed, and said that they were like the rest of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless was an admirable hostess, and she never appeared to better
      advantage in the character than during the time when Miss Gracia Raglan,
      Mr. John Vandewaters, and Mr. Stephen Pride were guests at Craigruie. The
      men accepted Mr. Vandewaters at once as a good fellow and a very sensible
      man. He was a heavy-weight for riding; but it was not the hunting season,
      and, when they did ride, a big horse carried him very well. At
      grouse-shooting he showed to advantage. Mr. Pride never rode. He went
      shooting only once, and then, as Mr. Vandewaters told him, he got
      &ldquo;rattled.&rdquo; He was then advised by his friend to remain at home and
      cultivate his finer faculties. At the same time, Mr. Vandewaters
      parenthetically remarked to Sir Duke Lawless that Mr. Pride knew the poets
      backwards, and was smart at French. He insisted on bringing out the good
      qualities of his comrade; but he gave him much strong advice privately. He
      would have done it just the same at the risk of losing a fortune, were it
      his whim&mdash;he would have won the fortune back in due course.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present time Mr. Vandewaters was in the heat of some large
      commercial movements. No one would have supposed it, save for the fact
      that telegrams and cablegrams were brought to him day and night. He had
      liberally salaried the telegraph-clerk to work after hours, simply to be
      at his service. The contents of these messages never shook his equanimity.
      He was quiet, urbane, dry-mannered, at all times. Mr. Pride, however, was
      naturally excitable. He said of himself earnestly that he had a sensitive
      nature. He said it to Mrs. Gregory Thorne, whose reply was: &ldquo;Dear me, and
      when things are irritating and painful to you do you never think of
      suicide?&rdquo; Then she turned away to speak to some one, as if she had been
      interrupted, and intended to take up the subject again; but she never did.
      This remark caused Mr. Pride some nervous moments. He was not quite sure
      how she meant it. But it did not depress him as it might otherwise have
      done, for his thoughts were running much in another channel with a foolish
      sort of elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lady Lawless had predicted, he was assiduously attentive to her, and it
      needed all her tact and cheerful frankness to keep him in line. She
      managed it very well: Mr. Pride&rsquo;s devotion was not too noticeable to the
      other guests. She tried to turn his attentions to some pretty girls; but,
      although there were one or two who might, in some weak moments, have
      compromised with his millions, he did no more than saunter with them on
      the terrace and oppress them with his lisping egotism. Every one hinted
      that he seemed an estimable, but trying, young man; and, as Sir Duke said
      to his wife, the men would not have him at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mr. Vandewaters and Gracia Raglan, Lady Lawless was not very sure
      that her delicate sympathy was certain of reward. The two were naturally
      thrown together a good deal; but Miss Raglan was a girl of singular
      individuality and high-mindedness, and she was keen enough to see from the
      start what Lady Lawless suspected might happen. She did not resent this,&mdash;she
      was a woman; but it roused in her a spirit of criticism, and she threw up
      a barrier of fine reserve, which puzzled Mr. Vandewaters. He did not see
      that Lady Lawless was making a possible courtship easy for him. If he had,
      it would have made no difference: he would have looked at it as at most
      things, broadly. He was not blind to the fact that his money might be a
      &ldquo;factor&rdquo;, but, as he said to himself, his millions were a part of him&mdash;they
      represented, like whist-counters, so much pluck and mother-wit. He liked
      the general appreciation of them: he knew very well that people saw him in
      them and them in him. Miss Raglan attracted him from the moment of
      meeting. She was the first woman of her class that he had ever met
      closely; and the possibility of having as his own so adorable a comrade
      was inspiring. He sat down sometimes as the days went on&mdash;it was
      generally when he was shaving&mdash;and thought upon his intention
      regarding Miss Raglan, in relation to his humble past; for he had fully
      made up his mind to marry her, if she would have him. He wondered what she
      would think when he told her of his life; and he laughed at the humour of
      the situation. He had been into Debrett, and he knew that she could trace
      her family back to the Crusades.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to make a clean breast of it. One day he was obliged to
      remain at the house in expectation of receiving important telegrams, and
      the only people who appeared at lunch were Lady Lawless, Mrs. Gregory
      Thorne (who was expecting her husband), Miss Raglan; Pride, and himself.
      While at luncheon he made up his mind to have a talk with Miss Raglan. In
      the library after luncheon the opportunity was given. It was a warm,
      pleasant day, and delightful in the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After one or two vain efforts to escape, Mrs. Gregory Thorne and Lady
      Lawless resigned themselves to the attentions of Mr. Pride; and for once
      Lady Lawless did not check Mrs. Thorne&rsquo;s irony. It was almost a
      satisfaction to see Mr. Pride&rsquo;s bewildered looks, and his inability to
      know whether or not he should resent (whether it would be proper to
      resent) this softly-showered satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vandewaters and Gracia Raglan talked more freely than they had ever
      done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really like England?&rdquo; she said to him; then, waving her hand
      lightly to the beeches and the clean-cropped grass through the window, &ldquo;I
      mean do you like our &lsquo;trim parterres,&rsquo; our devotion to mere living,
      pleasure, sport, squiring, and that sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head, glanced out, drew in a deep breath, thrust his hands
      down in the pockets of his coat, and looking at her with respectful good
      humour, said: &ldquo;Like it? Yes, right down to the ground. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I!
      It&rsquo;s the kind of place I should like to come to in my old days. You
      needn&rsquo;t die in a hurry here. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you would not be like the old sailors who must live where
      they can scent the brine? You have been used to an active, adventurous,
      hurried life. Do you think you could endure this humdrum of enjoyment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be hard to tell quite what was running in Gracia Raglan&rsquo;s mind,
      and, for the moment, she herself hardly knew; but she had a sudden,
      overmastering wish to make the man talk: to explore and, maybe, find
      surprising&mdash;even trying&mdash;things. She was astonished that she
      enjoyed his society so keenly. Even now, as she spoke, she remembered a
      day and a night since his coming, when he was absent in London; also how
      the party seemed to have lost its character and life, and how, when Mr.
      Pride condescended, for a few moments, to decline from Lady Lawless upon
      herself, she was even pleasant to him, making him talk about Mr.
      Vandewaters, and relishing the enthusiastic loyalty of the supine young
      man. She, like Lady Lawless, had learned to see behind the firm bold
      exterior, not merely a notable energy, force, self-reliance, and
      masterfulness, but a native courtesy, simplicity, and refinement which
      surprised her. Of all the men she knew not a half-dozen had an
      appreciation of nature or of art. They affected art, and some of them went
      to the Academy or the private views in Bond Street; but they had little
      feeling for the business. They did it in a well-bred way, with taste, but
      not with warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vandewaters now startled her by quoting suddenly lines from an English
      poet unknown to her. By chance she was turning over the Academy pictures
      of the year, and came at last to one called &ldquo;A Japanese Beauty of Old
      Days&rdquo;&mdash;an exquisite thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not fascinating?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So piquant and fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a silent laugh, as was his custom when he enjoyed anything, and
      then replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came across a little book of verses one day in the States. A friend of
      mine, the president of a big railway, gave it to me. He does some painting
      himself when he travels in his Pullman in the Rockies. Well, it had some
      verses on just such a picture as that. Hits it off right, Miss Raglan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verses?&rdquo; she remarked, lifting her eyebrows. She expected something out
      of the &ldquo;poet&rsquo;s corner&rdquo; of a country newspaper. &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one&rsquo;s enough to show the style. This is it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;&lsquo;Was I a Samurai renowned,
        Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow?
        A histrion angular and profound?
        A priest? or porter? Child, although
        I have forgotten clean, I know
        That in the shade of Fujisan,
        What time the cherry-orchards blow,
        I loved you once in old Japan.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The verse on the lips of Mr. Vandewaters struck her strangely. He was not
      like any man she had known. Most self-made Englishmen, with such a burly
      exterior and energy, and engaged in such pursuits, could not, to save
      themselves from hanging, have impressed her as Mr. Vandewaters did. There
      was a big round sympathy in the tone, a timbre in the voice, which made
      the words entirely fitting. Besides, he said them without any kind of
      affectation, and with a certain turn of dry humour, as if he were inwardly
      laughing at the idea of the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The verses are charming,&rdquo; she said, musingly; &ldquo;and the idea put that way
      is charming also. But do you think there would be much amusement in living
      half-a-dozen times, or even twice, unless you were quite sure that you
      remembered everything? This gentleman was peculiarly fortunate to recall
      Fujisan, and the orange orchards&mdash;and the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right. One life is about enough for most of us. Memory
      is all very fine; but you&rsquo;d want a life set apart for remembering the
      others after awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not add, &lsquo;And that would bore one?&rsquo; Most of the men I know
      would say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never used the word that way in my life. When I don&rsquo;t like a
      thing, that ends it&mdash;it has got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot do that with everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty much, if I set my mind to it. It is astonishing how things&rsquo;ll come
      round your way if you keep on thinking and willing them so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you always got everything you wanted?&rdquo; He had been looking off into
      the grounds through the open window. Now he turned slowly upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far I have got everything I set my mind to get. Little things don&rsquo;t
      count. You lose them sometimes because you want to work at something else;
      sometimes because, as in cards, you are throwing a few away to save the
      whole game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, as she thought, curiously. In his mind he was wondering
      if she knew that he had made up his mind to marry her. She was suddenly
      made aware of the masterfulness of his spirit, which might, she knew, be
      applied to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go into the grounds,&rdquo; he added, all at once. Soon after, in the
      shade of the trees, she broke in upon the thread of their casual
      conversation. &ldquo;A few moments ago,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you said: &lsquo;One life is
      about enough for most of us.&rsquo; Then you added a disparaging remark about
      memory. Well, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like your usual point of view&mdash;more
      like that of Mr. Pride; but not so plaintive, of course. Pray do smoke,&rdquo;
       she added, as, throwing back his coat, he exposed some cigars in his
      waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;I am sure you always smoke after lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out a cigar, cut off the end, and put it in his mouth. But he did
      not light it. Then he glanced up at her with a grave quizzical look as
      though wondering what would be the effect of his next words, and a smile
      played at his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I meant was this. I think we get enough out of our life to last us
      for centuries. It&rsquo;s all worth doing from the start, no matter what it is:
      working, fighting, marching and countermarching, plotting and
      counterplotting, backing your friends and hating your foes, playing big
      games and giving others a chance to, standing with your hand on the
      lynch-pin, or pulling your head safe out of the hot-pot. But I don&rsquo;t think
      it is worth doing twice. The interest wouldn&rsquo;t be fresh. For men and women
      and life, with a little different dress, are the same as they always were;
      and there&rsquo;s only the same number of passions working now, as at the
      beginning. I want to live life up to the hilt; because it is all new as I
      go on; but never twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; She looked at him earnestly for a moment, and then added: &ldquo;I
      should think you would have seen lost chances; and doing things a second
      time might do them better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never missed chances,&rdquo; he replied, simply: &ldquo;never except twice, and
      then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was to give the other fellow a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was a kind of dubiousness in her tone. He noticed it. &ldquo;You can
      hardly understand, Miss Raglan. Fact is, it was one of those deals when
      you can make a million, in a straight enough game; but it comes out of
      another man&mdash;one, maybe, that you don&rsquo;t know; who is playing just the
      same as you are. I have had a lot of sport; but I&rsquo;ve never crippled any
      one man, when my engine has been dead on him. I have played more against
      organisations than single men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the most remarkable chance you ever had to make a million, and
      did not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw back his head, smiling shrewdly. &ldquo;When by accident my enemy got
      hold of a telegram meant for me. I was standing behind a frosted glass
      door, and through the narrow bevel of clear glass I watched him read it. I
      never saw a struggle like that. At last he got up, snatched an envelope,
      put the telegram inside, wrote my name, and called a messenger. I knew
      what was in the message. I let the messenger go, and watched that man for
      ten minutes. It was a splendid sight. The telegram had given him a big
      chance to make a million or two, as he thought. But he backed himself
      against the temptation, and won. That day I could have put the ball into
      his wicket; but I didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s a funny case of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t. We are fighting yet. He is richer than I am now, and at this
      moment he&rsquo;s playing a hard game straight at several interests of mine. But
      I reckon I can stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get a great deal out of life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you always
      enjoyed it so?&rdquo; She was thinking it would be strange to live in contact
      with such events very closely. It was so like adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always&mdash;from the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something of it all, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He did not hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born in a little place in Maine. My mother was a good woman, they
      said&mdash;straight as a die all her life. I can only remember her in a
      kind of dream, when she used to gather us children about the big
      rocking-chair, and pray for us, and for my father, who was away most of
      the time, working in the timber-shanties in the winter, and at odd things
      in the summer. My father wasn&rsquo;t much of a man. He was kind-hearted, but
      shiftless, but pretty handsome for a man from Maine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother died when I was six years old. Things got bad. I was the
      youngest. The oldest was only ten years old. She was the head of the
      house. She had the pluck of a woman. We got along somehow, until one day,
      when she and I were scrubbing the floor, she caught cold. She died in
      three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused; and, without glancing at Miss Raglan, who sat very still,
      but looking at him, he lighted his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then things got worse. My father took to drinking hard, and we had mighty
      little to eat. I chored around, doing odd things in the village. I have
      often wondered that people didn&rsquo;t see the stuff that was in me, and give
      me a chance. They didn&rsquo;t, though. As for my relatives: one was a
      harness-maker. He sent me out in the dead of winter to post bills for
      miles about, and gave me ten cents for it. Didn&rsquo;t even give me a meal.
      Twenty years after he came to me and wanted to borrow a hundred dollars. I
      gave him five hundred on condition that he&rsquo;d not come near me for the rest
      of his natural life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next thing I did was to leave home&mdash;&lsquo;run away,&rsquo; I suppose, is
      the way to put it. I got to Boston, and went for a cabin-boy on a steamer;
      travelled down to Panama, and from there to Brazil. At Brazil I got on
      another ship, and came round to San Francisco. I got into trouble in San
      Francisco with the chief mate of the Flying Polly, because I tried to
      teach him his business. One of the first things I learned in life was not
      to interfere with people who had a trade and didn&rsquo;t understand it. In San
      Francisco I got out of the situation. I took to selling newspapers in the
      streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t enough money in it. I went for a cabin-boy again, and
      travelled to Australia. There, once more, I resigned my position, chiefly
      because I wouldn&rsquo;t cheerfully let the Mate bang me about the quarter-deck.
      I expect I was a precocious youth, and wasn&rsquo;t exactly the kind for
      Sunday-school prizes. In Melbourne I began to speculate. I found a ticket
      for the theatre where an American actor&mdash;our biggest actor today&mdash;was
      playing, and I tried to sell it outside the door of the theatre where they
      were crowding to see him. The man who bought it was the actor himself. He
      gave me two dollars more than the regular price. I expect he knew from my
      voice I was an American. Is there anything peculiar about my voice, Miss
      Raglan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him quickly, smiled, and said in a low tone: &ldquo;Yes, something
      peculiar. Please go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, he said to me: &lsquo;Look here, where did you come from, my
      boy?&rsquo; I told him the State of Maine. &lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo; he asked.
      &lsquo;Speculating, said I, and seeing things.&rsquo; He looked me up and down. &lsquo;How
      are you getting on?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well. I&rsquo;ve made four dollars to-day,&rsquo; I answered.
      &lsquo;Out of this ticket?&rsquo; I expect I grinned. He suddenly caught me by the arm
      and whisked me inside the theatre&mdash;the first time I&rsquo;d ever been in a
      theatre in my life. I shall never forget it. He took me around to his
      dressing-room, stuck me in a corner, and prodded me with his forefinger.
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll hire you to speculate for me.&rsquo; And
      that&rsquo;s how I came to get twenty-five dollars a month and my living from a
      great American actor. When I got back to America&mdash;with him&mdash;I
      had two hundred and fifty dollars in cash, and good clothes. I started a
      peanut-stand, and sold papers and books, and became a speculator. I heard
      two men talking one day at my stall about a railway that was going to run
      through a certain village, and how they intended to buy up the whole
      place. I had four hundred and fifty dollars then. I went down to that
      village, and bought some lots myself. I made four thousand dollars. Then I
      sold more books, and went on speculating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, blew his cigar-smoke slowly from him a moment; then turned with
      a quick look to Miss Raglan, and smiled as at some incongruous thing. He
      was wondering what would be the effect of his next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was about twenty-two, and had ten thousand dollars, I fell in
      love. She was a bright-faced, smart girl. Her mother kept a boarding-house
      in New York; not an up-town boarding-house. She waited on table. I suppose
      a man can be clever in making money, and knowing how to handle men, and
      not know much about women. I thought she was worth a good deal more to me
      than the ten thousand dollars. She didn&rsquo;t know I had that money. A drummer&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a commercial traveller&mdash;came along, who had a salary of, maybe, a
      thousand dollars a year. She jilted me. She made a mistake. That year I
      made twenty-five thousand dollars. I saw her a couple of years ago. She
      was keeping a boarding-house too, and her daughter was waiting on table.
      I&rsquo;m sorry for that girl: it isn&rsquo;t any fun being poor. I didn&rsquo;t take much
      interest in women after that. I put my surplus affections into stocks and
      shares, and bulling and bearing... Well, that is the way the thing has
      gone till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of your father and your brother?&rdquo; she asked in a neutral
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about my father. He disappeared after I left, and
      never turned up again. And Jim&mdash;poor Jim!&mdash;he was shiftless. Jim
      was a tanner. It was no good setting him up in business. Steady income was
      the cheapest way. But Jim died of too much time on his hands. His son is
      in Mexico somewhere. I sent him there, and I hope he&rsquo;ll stay. If he
      doesn&rsquo;t, his salary stops: he is shiftless too. That is not the kind of
      thing, and they are not the kind of people you know best, Miss Raglan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, eyes full-front, bravely, honestly, ready to face the
      worst. Her head was turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to himself. It was as he feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a boy came running along the walk towards them, and handed
      Mr. Vandewaters a telegram. He gave the lad a few pence, then, with an
      apology, opened the telegram. Presently he whistled softly, in a quick
      surprised way. Then he stuffed the paper into his waistcoat pocket, threw
      away his cigar, and turned to Gracia Raglan, whose face as yet was only
      half towards him. &ldquo;I hope your news is good,&rdquo; she said very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty bad, in a way,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have lost a couple of millions&mdash;maybe
      a little more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gasped, and turned an astonished face on him. He saw her startled
      look, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it not worry you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got more important things on hand just now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Very
      much more important,&rdquo; he added, and there was that in his voice which made
      her turn away her head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the story you have just heard is not the
      kind of an autobiography you would care to have told in your
      drawing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not reply; but her hands were clasped tightly in front of
      her. &ldquo;No: I suppose not,&rdquo; he went on&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose not. And
      yet, do you know, Miss Raglan, I don&rsquo;t feel a bit ashamed of it, after
      all: which may be evidence of my lost condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now she turned to him with a wonderful light in her eyes, her sweet,
      strong face rich with feeling. She put out her hand to his arm, and
      touched it quickly, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story has touched me inexpressibly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not know that
      men could be so strong and frank and courageous as you. I did not know
      that men could be so great; that any man could think more of what a woman
      thought of&mdash;of his life&rsquo;s story&mdash;than of&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, and
      then gave a trembling little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;of two millions or more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got to his feet, and faced her. &ldquo;You&mdash;you are a woman, by heaven!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;You are finer even than I thought you. I am not worthy to ask
      you what I had in my mind to ask you; but there is no man in God&rsquo;s
      universe who would prize you as I do. I may be a poor man before sundown.
      If that happens, though, I shall remember the place where I had the
      biggest moment of my life, and the woman who made that moment possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now she also rose. There was a brave high look in her face; but her voice
      shook a little as she said: &ldquo;You have never been a coward, why be a coward
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smiling, he slowly answered: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I were sure about my dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, but glanced down, not with coquetry, but because she
      could not stand the furnace of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said a moment ago,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;that you have had one big moment
      in your life. Oughtn&rsquo;t it to bring you good fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will&mdash;it will,&rdquo; he said, reaching his hand towards hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she rejoined archly. &ldquo;I am going. Please do not follow me.&rdquo;
       Then, over her shoulder, as she left him: &ldquo;If you have luck, I shall want
      a subscription for my hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As many thousands as you like,&rdquo; he answered: then, as she sped away: &ldquo;I
      will have her, and the millions too!&rdquo; adding reminiscently: &ldquo;Yes, Lady
      Lawless, this is my biggest deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tramped to the stables, asked for and got a horse, and rode away to the
      railway station. It was dinner time when he got back. He came down to
      dinner late, apologising to Lady Lawless as he did so. Glancing across the
      table at Mr. Pride, he saw a peculiar excited look in the young man&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The baby fool!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting into mischief. I&rsquo;ll
      startle him. If he knows that an army of his dollars is playing at
      fox-and-geese, he&rsquo;ll not make eyes at Lady Lawless this way&mdash;little
      ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless appeared oblivious of the young man&rsquo;s devotional exercises.
      She was engaged on a more congenial theme. In spite of Miss Raglan&rsquo;s
      excellent acting, she saw that something had occurred. Mr. Vandewaters was
      much the same as usual, save that his voice had an added ring. She was not
      sure that all was right; but she was determined to know. Sir Duke was
      amused generally. He led a pretty by-play with Mrs. Gregory Thorne, of
      whom he asked the details of the day, much to the confusion, not admirably
      hid, of Mr. Pride; lamenting now and then Mr. Vandewaters&rsquo;s absence from
      the shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vandewaters was cool enough. He said that he had been playing at
      nine-pins with railways, which was good enough sport for him. Soon after
      dinner, he was handed two telegrams. He glanced slowly up at Pride, as if
      debating whether to tell him something. He evidently decided against it,
      and, excusing himself by saying he was off to take a little walk in Wall
      Street, went away to the telegraph office, where he stayed three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnitude of the concerns, the admirable stoicism with which he
      received alarming news, his dry humour while they waited between messages&mdash;all
      were so unlike anything the telegraph-clerk had ever seen, or imagined,
      that the thing was like a preposterous dream. Even when, at last, a
      telegram came which the clerk vaguely felt was, somehow, like the fall of
      an empire, Mr. Vandewaters remained unmoved. Then he sent one more
      telegram, gave the clerk a pound, asked that the reply be sent to him as
      soon as it came, and went away, calmly smoking his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mild night. When he got to the house he found some of the guests
      walking on the veranda. He joined them; but Miss Raglan was not with them;
      nor were Lady Lawless and Mr. Pride. He wanted to see all three, and so he
      went into the house. There was no one in the drawing-room. He reached the
      library in time to hear Lady Lawless say to Mr. Pride, who was
      disappearing through another door: &ldquo;You had better ask advice of Mr.
      Vandewaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed. Mr. Vandewaters stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood the situation. &ldquo;I guess I know how to advise him, Lady
      Lawless,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him quietly, traces of hauteur in her manner. Her self-pride
      had been hurt. &ldquo;You have heard?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only your last words, Lady Lawless. They were enough. I feel guilty in
      having brought him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not. I was glad to have your friend. He is young and effusive.
      Let us say no more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is tragically repentant; which is a pity. There is no reason why he
      should not stay, and be sensible. Why should young men lose their heads,
      and be so absurdly earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another poser, Lady Lawless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all your life you never misunderstood things so, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is no virtue in keeping your head steady. I have spent most
      of my life wooing Madame Fortune; I find that makes a man canny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been very kind to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would surprise you if I told you that at this moment I am not
      worth ten thousand dollars.&rdquo; She looked greatly astonished. &ldquo;I do not
      understand,&rdquo; she said. She was thinking of what this might mean to Gracia
      Raglan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I&rsquo;ve been playing games at a disadvantage with some ruffians at
      New York. They have combined and got me into a corner. I have made my last
      move. If it comes out right I shall be richer than ever; if not I must
      begin all over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless looked at him curiously. She had never met a man like him
      before. His power seemed almost Napoleonic; his imperturbability was
      absolute. Yet she noticed something new in him. On one side a kind of grim
      forcefulness; on the other, a quiet sort of human sympathy. The one, no
      doubt, had to do with the momentous circumstances amid which he was
      placed; the other, with an event which she had, perhaps prematurely,
      anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;I wonder at you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How do you keep so cool while
      such tremendous things are happening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I believe in myself, Lady Lawless. I have had to take my measure
      a good many times in this world. I never was defeated through my own
      stupidity. It has been the sheer luck of the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not look like a gamester,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s all pretty much a game in life, if you look at it right. It
      is only a case of playing fair or foul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard any Englishmen talk as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be unpleasant; but most
      Englishmen work things out by the rule their fathers taught them, and not
      by native ingenuity. It is native wit that tells in the end, I&rsquo;m
      thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;There must be a kind of genius in
      it.&rdquo; Here her voice dropped a little lower. &ldquo;I do not believe there are
      many Englishmen, even if they had your dollars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dollars I had this morning,&rdquo; he interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;who could have so strongly impressed Gracia Raglan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked thoughtfully on the ground; then raised his eyes to Lady
      Lawless, and said in a low, ringing tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going to do more than &lsquo;impress&rsquo;: I am going to convince her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning, I hope,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I believe I shall have my
      millions again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;do you not think that you ought to run no
      more risks&mdash;for her sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I mean to do, Lady Lawless. I&rsquo;ll settle millions where
      they ought to be settled, drop Wall Street, and&mdash;go into training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into training?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for a house on the Hudson, a villa at Cannes, a residence in
      Grosvenor Square, and a place in Devonshire&mdash;or somewhere else.
      Then,&rdquo; he added, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;I shall need a good deal of
      time to cultivate accent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are much more charming as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these things to be told?&rdquo; she asked, with a little suggestion in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can trust your discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in such circumstances?&rdquo; she asked. She paused, with a motion of her
      fan back towards the room they had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taught him a lesson, Lady Lawless. It is rough on him; but he
      needs it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will do nothing rash,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll write some poetry, and refuse to consider his natural
      appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go and see him now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Immediately. Good night, Lady
      Lawless.&rdquo; His big hand swallowed hers in a firm, friendly clasp, and he
      shook it once or twice before he parted from her. He met Sir Duke Lawless
      in the doorway. They greeted cheerfully, and then Lawless came up to his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; he said, with an amused look in his face, &ldquo;well, what
      news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyebrows at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened, Molly, I can see it in your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was very brief. &ldquo;Gracia Raglan has been conquered; the young man from
      Boston has been foolish; and Mr. Vandewaters has lost millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? That&rsquo;s awkward,&rdquo; said Sir Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vandewaters found Mr. Pride in his bedroom, a waif of melancholy. He drew
      a chair up, lighted a cigar, eyed the young man from head to foot, and
      then said: &ldquo;Pride, have you got any backbone? If you have, brace up. You
      are ruined. That&rsquo;s about as mild as I can put it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all?&rdquo;&mdash;said the young man helplessly, his hands clasped
      between his knees in aesthetic agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know more than you do, as you will find out. You&rsquo;re a nice sort of
      man, to come into a man&rsquo;s house, in a strange land, and make love to his
      wife. Now, what do you think of yourself? You&rsquo;re a nice representative of
      the American, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm&mdash;I&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; replied
      the stricken boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, for God&rsquo;s sake, drop that bib-and-tucker twaddle! Couldn&rsquo;t help it!
      Every scoundrel, too weak to face the consequences of his sin, says he
      couldn&rsquo;t help it. So help me, Joseph, I&rsquo;d like to thrash you. Couldn&rsquo;t
      help it! Now, sit up in your chair, take this cigar, drink this glass of
      whiskey I&rsquo;m pouring for you, and make up your mind that you&rsquo;re going to be
      a man and not a nincompoop&mdash;sit still! Don&rsquo;t fly up. I mean what I
      say. I&rsquo;ve got business to talk to you. And make up your mind that, for
      once, you have got to take life seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have you to speak to me like this?&rdquo; demanded the young man
      with an attempt at dignity. Vandewaters laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right? Great Scott! The right of a man who thinks a damned sight more of
      your reputation than you do yourself, and of your fortune than you would
      ever have wits to do. I am the best friend you&rsquo;ve got, and not the less
      your friend because I feel like breaking your ribs. Now, enough of that.
      This is what I have to say, Pride: to-night you and I are beggars. You
      understand? Beggars. Out in the cold world, out in the street. Now, what
      do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shock to Mr. Pride was great. Mr. Vandewaters had exaggerated the
      disaster; but he had done it with a purpose. The youth gasped &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;
       and dropped his glass. Vandewaters picked it up, and regarded him a moment
      in silence. Then he began to explain their financial position. He did not
      explain the one bold stroke which he was playing to redeem their fortunes:
      if possible. When he had finished the story, he said, &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s a
      bit more serious than the little affair in the library half an hour ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet. &ldquo;Look here, Pride, be a man. You&rsquo;ve never tried it
      yet. Let me teach you how to face the world without a dollar; how to make
      a fortune. Then, when you&rsquo;ve made it, you&rsquo;ll get what you&rsquo;ve never had yet&mdash;the
      pleasure of spending money dug out of your own wits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carried conviction into a mind not yet all destroyed by effeminacy and
      indulgence of the emotions. Something of the iron of his own brain got
      into the brain of the young man, who came to his feet trembling a little,
      and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it so much, if you only stick to me, Vandewaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile flickered about the corners of Vandewaters&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a little more whiskey,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;then get into bed, and go to
      sleep. No nonsense, remember; go to sleep. To-morrow morning we will talk.
      And see here, my boy,&rdquo;&mdash;he caught him by both arms and fastened his
      eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;you have had a lesson: learn it backwards. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Mr. Vandewaters was early in the grounds. He chatted with the
      gardener, and discussed the merits of the horses with the groom,
      apparently at peace with the world. Yet he was watching vigilantly the
      carriage-drive from the public-road. Just before breakfast-time a
      telegraph messenger appeared. Vandewaters was standing with Sir Duke
      Lawless when the message was handed to him. He read it, put it into his
      pocket, and went on talking. Presently he said: &ldquo;My agent is coming from
      town this morning, Sir Duke. I may have to leave to-night.&rdquo; Then he
      turned, and went to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lawless had heard his last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about your ranche in Colorado, Duke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as sure, I fancy, as your millionaire for Gracia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Raglan did not appear at breakfast with the rest. Neither did Mr.
      Pride, who slept late that morning. About ten o&rsquo;clock Mr. Vandewaters&rsquo;s
      agent arrived. About twelve o&rsquo;clock Mr. Vandewaters saw Miss Raglan
      sitting alone in the library. He was evidently looking for her. He came up
      to her quietly, and put a piece of paper in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she asked, a little startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand for your hospital,&rdquo; was the meaning reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed, and came to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have won,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he reached out and took both her hands.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
