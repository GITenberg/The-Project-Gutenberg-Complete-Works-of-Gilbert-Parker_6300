    <h2>
      GENERAL INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      With each volume of this subscription edition (1912) there is a special
      introduction, setting forth, in so far as seemed possible, the relation of
      each work to myself, to its companion works, and to the scheme of my
      literary life. Only one or two things, therefore, need be said here, as I
      wish God-speed to this edition, which, I trust, may help to make old
      friends warmer friends and new friends more understanding. Most of the
      novels and most of the short stories were suggested by incidents or
      characters which I had known, had heard of intimately, or, as in the case
      of the historical novels, had discovered in the works of historians. In no
      case are the main characters drawn absolutely from life; they are not
      portraits; and the proof of that is that no one has ever been able to
      identify, absolutely, any single character in these books. Indeed, it
      would be impossible for me to restrict myself to actual portraiture. It is
      trite to say that photography is not art, and photography has no charm for
      the artist, or the humanitarian indeed, in the portrayal of life. At its
      best it is only an exhibition of outer formal characteristics,
      idiosyncrasies, and contours. Freedom is the first essential of the
      artistic mind. As will be noticed in the introductions and original notes
      to several of these volumes, it is stated that they possess anachronisms;
      that they are not portraits of people living or dead, and that they only
      assume to be in harmony with the spirit of men and times and things.
      Perhaps in the first few pages of &lsquo;The Right of Way&rsquo; portraiture is more
      nearly reached than in any other of these books, but it was only the
      nucleus, if I may say so, of a larger development which the original
      Charley Steele never attained. In the novel he grew to represent
      infinitely more than the original ever represented in his short life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would not be strange when it is remembered that the germ of The
      &lsquo;Right of Way&rsquo; was growing in my mind over a long period of years, and it
      must necessarily have developed into a larger conception than the original
      character could have suggested. The same may be said of the chief
      characters in &lsquo;The Weavers&rsquo;. The story of the two brothers&mdash;David
      Claridge and Lord Eglington&mdash;in that book was brewing in my mind for
      quite fifteen years, and the main incidents and characters of other novels
      in this edition had the same slow growth. My forthcoming novel, called
      &lsquo;The Judgment House&rsquo;, had been in my mind for nearly twenty years and only
      emerged when it was full grown, as it were; when I was so familiar with
      the characters that they seemed as real in all ways as though they were
      absolute people and incidents of one&rsquo;s own experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little more need be said. In outward form the publishers have made this
      edition beautiful. I should be ill-content if there was not also an
      element of beauty in the work of the author. To my mind truth alone is not
      sufficient. Every work of art, no matter how primitive in conception, how
      tragic or how painful, or even how grotesque in design&mdash;like the
      gargoyles on Notre Dame must have, too, the elements of beauty&mdash;that
      which lures and holds, the durable and delightful thing. I have a hope
      that these books of mine, as faithful to life as I could make them, have
      also been touched here and there by the staff of beauty. Otherwise their
      day will be short indeed; and I should wish for them a day a little longer
      at least than my day and span.
    </p>
    <p>
      I launch the ship. May it visit many a port! May its freight never lie
      neglected on the quays!

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      So far as my literary work is concerned &lsquo;Pierre and His People&rsquo; may be
      likened to a new city built upon the ashes of an old one. Let me explain.
      While I was in Australia I began a series of short stories and sketches of
      life in Canada which I called &lsquo;Pike Pole Sketches on the Madawaska&rsquo;. A
      very few of them were published in Australia, and I brought with me to
      England in 1889 about twenty of them to make into a volume. I told
      Archibald Forbes, the great war correspondent, of my wish for publication,
      and asked him if he would mind reading the sketches and stories before I
      approached a publisher. He immediately consented, and one day I brought
      him the little brown bag containing the tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards there came an invitation to lunch, and I went to
      Clarence Gate, Regent&rsquo;s Park, to learn what Archibald Forbes thought of my
      tales. We were quite merry at luncheon, and after luncheon, which for him
      was a glass of milk and a biscuit, Forbes said to me, &ldquo;Those stories,
      Parker&mdash;you have the best collection of titles I have ever known.&rdquo; He
      paused. I understood. To his mind the tales did not live up to their
      titles. He hastily added, &ldquo;But I am going to give you a letter of
      introduction to Macmillan. I may be wrong.&rdquo; My reply was: &ldquo;You need not
      give me a letter to Macmillan unless I write and ask you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took my little brown bag and went back to my comfortable rooms in an
      old-fashioned square. I sat down before the fire on this bleak winter&rsquo;s
      night with a couple of years&rsquo; work on my knee. One by one I glanced
      through the stories and in some cases read them carefully, and one by one
      I put them in the fire, and watched them burn. I was heavy at heart, but I
      felt that Forbes was right, and my own instinct told me that my ideas were
      better than my performance&mdash;and Forbes was right. Nothing was left of
      the tales; not a shred of paper, not a scrap of writing. They had all gone
      up the chimney in smoke. There was no self-pity. I had a grim kind of
      feeling regarding the thing, but I had no regrets, and I have never had
      any regrets since. I have forgotten most of the titles, and indeed all the
      stories except one. But Forbes and I were right; of that I am sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day after the arson I walked for hours where London was busiest.
      The shop windows fascinated me; they always did; but that day I seemed,
      subconsciously, to be looking for something. At last I found it. It was a
      second-hand shop in Covent Garden. In the window there was the uniform of
      an officer of the time of Wellington, and beside it&mdash;the leather coat
      and fur cap of a trapper of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company! At that window I
      commenced to build again upon the ashes of last night&rsquo;s fire. Pretty
      Pierre, the French half-breed, or rather the original of him as I knew him
      when a child, looked out of the window at me. So I went home, and sitting
      in front of the fire which had received my manuscript the night before,
      with a pad upon my knee, I began to write &lsquo;The Patrol of the Cypress
      Hills&rsquo; which opens &lsquo;Pierre and His People&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Sunday. I went to service at the Foundling Hospital in
      Bloomsbury, and while listening superficially to the sermon I was also
      reading the psalms. I came upon these words, &ldquo;Free among the Dead like
      unto them that are wounded and lie in the grave, that are out of
      remembrance,&rdquo; and this text, which I used in the story &lsquo;The Patrol of the
      Cypress Hills&rsquo;, became, in a sense, the text for all the stories which
      came after. It seemed to suggest the lives and the end of the lives of the
      workers of the pioneer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that Pierre and His People chiefly concerned those who had been
      wounded by Fate, and had suffered the robberies of life and time while
      they did their work in the wide places. It may be that my readers have
      found what I tried, instinctively, to convey in the pioneer life I
      portrayed&mdash;&ldquo;The soul of goodness in things evil.&rdquo; Such, on the whole,
      my observation had found in life, and the original of Pierre, with all his
      mistakes, misdemeanours, and even crimes, was such an one as I would have
      gone to in trouble or in hour of need, knowing that his face would never
      be turned from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories made their place at once. The &lsquo;Patrol of the Cypress Hills&rsquo; 
      was published first in &lsquo;The Independent&rsquo; of New York and in &lsquo;Macmillan&rsquo;s
      Magazine&rsquo; in England. Mr. Bliss Carman, then editor of &lsquo;The Independent&rsquo;,
      eagerly published several of them&mdash;&lsquo;She of the Triple Chevron&rsquo; and
      others. Mr. Carman&rsquo;s sympathy and insight were a great help to me in those
      early days. The then editor of &lsquo;Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo;, Mr. Mowbray Morris,
      was not, I think, quite so sure of the merits of the Pierre stories. He
      published them, but he was a little credulous regarding them, and he did
      not pat me on the back by any means. There was one, however, who made the
      best that is in &lsquo;Pierre and His People&rsquo; possible; this was the
      unforgettable W. E. Henley, editor of The &lsquo;National Observer&rsquo;. One day at
      a sitting I wrote a short story called &lsquo;Antoine and Angelique&rsquo;, and sent
      it to him almost before the ink was dry. The reply came by return of post:
      &ldquo;It is almost, or quite, as good as can be. Send me another.&rdquo; So forthwith
      I sent him &lsquo;God&rsquo;s Garrison&rsquo;, and it was quickly followed by &lsquo;The Three
      Outlaws&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Tall Master&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Flood&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Cipher&rsquo;, &lsquo;A Prairie
      Vagabond&rsquo;, and several others. At length came &lsquo;The Stone&rsquo;, which brought a
      telegram of congratulation, and finally &lsquo;The Crimson Flag&rsquo;. The
      acknowledgment of that was a postcard containing these all too-flattering
      words: &ldquo;Bravo, Balzac!&rdquo; Henley would print what no other editor would
      print; he gave a man his chance to do the boldest thing that was in him,
      and I can truthfully say that the doors which he threw open gave freedom
      to an imagination and an individuality of conception, for which I can
      never be sufficiently grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories and others which appeared in &lsquo;The National Observer&rsquo;, in
      &lsquo;Macmillan&rsquo;s&rsquo;, in &lsquo;The English Illustrated Magazine&rsquo; and others made many
      friends; so that when the book at length came out it was received with
      generous praise, though not without some criticism. It made its place,
      however, at once, and later appeared another series, called &lsquo;An Adventurer
      of the North&rsquo;, or, as it is called in this edition, &lsquo;A Romany of the
      Snows&rsquo;. Through all the twenty stories of this second volume the character
      of Pierre moved; and by the time the last was written there was scarcely
      an important magazine in the English-speaking world which had not printed
      one or more of them. Whatever may be thought of the stories themselves, or
      of the manner in which the life of the Far North was portrayed, of one
      thing I am sure: Pierre was true to the life&mdash;to his race, to his
      environment, to the conditions of pioneer life through which he moved.
      When the book first came out there was some criticism from Canada itself,
      but that criticism has long since died away, and it never was determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plays have been founded on the &lsquo;Pierre&rsquo; series, and one in particular,
      &lsquo;Pierre of the Plains&rsquo;, had a considerable success, with Mr. Edgar Selwyn,
      the adapter, in the main part. I do not know whether, if I were to begin
      again, I should have written all the Pierre stories in quite the same way.
      Perhaps it is just as well that I am not able to begin again. The stories
      made their own place in their own way, and that there is still a steady
      demand for &lsquo;Pierre and His People&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Romany of the Snows&rsquo; seems
      evidence that the editor of an important magazine in New York who declined
      to recommend them for publication to his firm (and later published several
      of the same series) was wrong, when he said that the tales &ldquo;seemed not to
      be salient.&rdquo; Things that are not &ldquo;salient&rdquo; do not endure. It is twenty
      years since &lsquo;Pierre and His People&rsquo; was produced&mdash;and it still
      endures. For this I cannot but be deeply grateful. In any case, what
      &lsquo;Pierre&rsquo; did was to open up a field which had not been opened before, but
      which other authors have exploited since with success and distinction.
      &lsquo;Pierre&rsquo; was the pioneer of the Far North in fiction; that much may be
      said; and for the rest, Time is the test, and Time will have its way with
      me as with the rest.

    <h2>
      NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is possible that a Note on the country portrayed in these stories may
      be in keeping. Until 1870, the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&mdash;first granted
      its charter by King Charles II&mdash;practically ruled that vast region
      stretching from the fiftieth parallel of latitude to the Arctic Ocean&mdash;a
      handful of adventurous men entrenched in forts and posts, yet trading
      with, and mostly peacefully conquering, many savage tribes. Once the sole
      master of the North, the H. B. C. (as it is familiarly called) is
      reverenced by the Indians and half-breeds as much as, if not more than,
      the Government established at Ottawa. It has had its forts within the
      Arctic Circle; it has successfully exploited a country larger than the
      United States. The Red River Valley, the Saskatchewan Valley, and British
      Columbia, are now belted by a great railway, and given to the plough; but
      in the far north life is much the same as it was a hundred years ago.
      There the trapper, clerk, trader, and factor are cast in the mould of
      another century, though possessing the acuter energies of this. The
      &lsquo;voyageur&rsquo; and &lsquo;courier de bois&rsquo; still exist, though, generally, under
      less picturesque names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bare story of the hardy and wonderful career of the adventurers
      trading in Hudson&rsquo;s Bay,&mdash;of whom Prince Rupert was once chiefest,&mdash;and
      the life of the prairies, may be found in histories and books of travel;
      but their romances, the near narratives of individual lives, have waited
      the telling. In this book I have tried to feel my way towards the heart of
      that life&mdash;worthy of being loved by all British men, for it has given
      honest graves to gallant fellows of our breeding. Imperfectly, of course,
      I have done it; but there is much more to be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I started Pretty Pierre on his travels, I did not know&mdash;nor did
      he&mdash;how far or wide his adventurers and experiences would run. They
      have, however, extended from Quebec in the east to British Columbia in the
      west, and from the Cypress Hills in the south to the Coppermine River in
      the north. With a less adventurous man we had had fewer happenings. His
      faults were not of his race, that is, French and Indian,&mdash;nor were
      his virtues; they belong to all peoples. But the expression of these is
      affected by the country itself. Pierre passes through this series of
      stories, connecting them, as he himself connects two races, and here and
      there links the past of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company with more modern life and
      Canadian energy pushing northward. Here is something of romance &ldquo;pure and
      simple,&rdquo; but also traditions and character, which are the single property
      of this austere but not cheerless heritage of our race.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      THE PATROL OF THE CYPRESS HILLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too ha&rsquo;sh,&rdquo; said old Alexander Windsor, as he shut the creaking door
      of the store after a vanishing figure, and turned to the big iron stove
      with outstretched hands; hands that were cold both summer and winter. He
      was of lean and frigid make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant Fones is too ha&rsquo;sh,&rdquo; he repeated, as he pulled out the damper
      and cleared away the ashes with the iron poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre blew a quick, straight column of cigarette smoke into the
      air, tilted his chair back, and said: &ldquo;I do not know what you mean by
      &lsquo;ha&rsquo;sh,&rsquo; but he is the devil. Eh, well, there was more than one devil made
      sometime in the North West.&rdquo; He laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gives you a chance in history, Pretty Pierre,&rdquo; said a voice from
      behind a pile of woollen goods and buffalo skins in the centre of the
      floor. The owner of the voice then walked to the window. He scratched some
      frost from the pane and looked out to where the trooper in dog-skin coat,
      gauntlets and cap, was mounting his broncho. The old man came and stood
      near the young man,&mdash;the owner of the voice,&mdash;and said again:
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too ha&rsquo;sh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harsh you mean, father,&rdquo; added the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, harsh you mean, Old Brown Windsor,&mdash;quite harsh,&rdquo; said Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Windsor, storekeeper and general dealer, was sometimes called
      &ldquo;Old Brown Windsor&rdquo; and sometimes &ldquo;Old Aleck,&rdquo; to distinguish him from his
      son, who was known as &ldquo;Young Aleck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the old man walked back again to the stove to warm his hands, Young
      Aleck continued: &ldquo;He does his duty, that&rsquo;s all. If he doesn&rsquo;t wear kid
      gloves while at it, it&rsquo;s his choice. He doesn&rsquo;t go beyond his duty. You
      can bank on that. It would be hard to exceed that way out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Young Aleck, so true; but then he wears gloves of iron, of ice.
      That is not good. Sometime the glove will be too hard and cold on a man&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and then!&mdash;Well, I should like to be there,&rdquo; said Pierre,
      showing his white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Aleck shivered, and held his fingers where the stove was red hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not hear this speech; from the window he was watching
      Sergeant Fones as he rode towards the Big Divide. Presently he said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      going towards Humphrey&rsquo;s place. I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, bent his brows,
      caught one corner of his slight moustache between his teeth, and did not
      stir a muscle until the Sergeant had passed over the Divide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Aleck was meanwhile dilating upon his theme before a passive listener.
      But Pierre was only passive outwardly. Besides hearkening to the father&rsquo;s
      complaints he was closely watching the son. Pierre was clever, and a good
      actor. He had learned the power of reserve and outward immobility. The
      Indian in him helped him there. He had heard what Young Aleck had just
      muttered; but to the man of the cold fingers he said: &ldquo;You keep good
      whisky in spite of the law and the iron glove, Old Aleck.&rdquo; To the young
      man: &ldquo;And you can drink it so free, eh, Young Aleck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed looked out of the corners of his eyes at the young man, but
      he did not raise the peak of his fur cap in doing so, and his glances
      askance were not seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Aleck had been writing something with his finger-nail on the frost
      of the pane, over and over again. When Pierre spoke to him thus he
      scratched out the word he had written, with what seemed unnecessary force.
      But in one corner it remained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mab&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre added: &ldquo;That is what they say at Humphrey&rsquo;s ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says that at Humphrey&rsquo;s?&mdash;Pierre, you lie!&rdquo; was the sharp and
      threatening reply. The significance of this last statement had been often
      attested on the prairies by the piercing emphasis of a six-chambered
      revolver. It was evident that Young Aleck was in earnest. Pierre&rsquo;s eyes
      glowed in the shadow, but he idly replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not remember quite who said it. Well, &lsquo;mon ami,&rsquo; perhaps I lie;
      perhaps. Sometimes we dream things, and these dreams are true. You call it
      a lie&mdash;&lsquo;bien!&rsquo; Sergeant Fones, he dreams perhaps Old Aleck sells
      whisky against the law to men you call whisky runners, sometimes to
      Indians and half-breeds&mdash;halfbreeds like Pretty Pierre. That was a
      dream of Sergeant Fones; but you see he believes it true. It is good
      sport, eh? Will you not take&mdash;what is it?&mdash;a silent partner?
      Yes; a silent partner, Old Aleck. Pretty Pierre has spare time, a little,
      to make money for his friends and for himself, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When did not Pierre have time to spare? He was a gambler. Unlike the
      majority of half-breeds, he had a pronounced French manner, nonchalant and
      debonair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian in him gave him coolness and nerve. His cheeks had a tinge of
      delicate red under their whiteness, like those of a woman. That was why he
      was called Pretty Pierre. The country had, however, felt a kind of weird
      menace in the name. It was used to snakes whose rattle gave notice of
      approach or signal of danger. But Pretty Pierre was like the death-adder,
      small and beautiful, silent and deadly. At one time he had made a secret
      of his trade, or thought he was doing so. In those days he was often to be
      seen at David Humphrey&rsquo;s home, and often in talk with Mab Humphrey; but it
      was there one night that the man who was ha&rsquo;sh gave him his true
      character, with much candour and no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards Pierre was not seen at Humphrey&rsquo;s ranch. Men prophesied that he
      would have revenge some day on Sergeant Fones; but he did not show
      anything on which this opinion could be based. He took no umbrage at being
      called Pretty Pierre the gambler. But for all that he was possessed of a
      devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Aleck had inherited some money through his dead mother from his
      grandfather, a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay factor. He had been in the East for some
      years, and when he came back he brought his &ldquo;little pile&rdquo; and an
      impressionable heart with him. The former Pretty Pierre and his friends
      set about to win; the latter, Mab Humphrey won without the trying. Yet Mab
      gave Young Aleck as much as he gave her. More. Because her love sprang
      from a simple, earnest, and uncontaminated life. Her purity and affection
      were being played against Pierre&rsquo;s designs and Young Aleck&rsquo;s weakness.
      With Aleck cards and liquor went together. Pierre seldom drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of Sergeant Fones? If the man that knew him best&mdash;the
      Commandant&mdash;had been asked for his history, the reply would have
      been: &ldquo;Five years in the Service, rigid disciplinarian, best
      non-commissioned officer on the Patrol of the Cypress Hills.&rdquo; That was all
      the Commandant knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soldier-policeman&rsquo;s life on the frontier is rough, solitary, and severe.
      Active duty and responsibility are all that make it endurable. To few is
      it fascinating. A free and thoughtful nature would, however, find much in
      it, in spite of great hardships, to give interest and even pleasure. The
      sense of breadth and vastness, and the inspiration of pure air could be a
      very gospel of strength, beauty, and courage, to such an one&mdash;for a
      time. But was Sergeant Fones such an one? The Commandant&rsquo;s scornful reply
      to a question of the kind would have been: &ldquo;He is the best soldier on the
      Patrol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so with hard gallops here and there after the refugees of crime or
      misfortune, or both, who fled before them like deer among the passes of
      the hills, and, like deer at bay, often fought like demons to the death;
      with border watchings, and protection and care and vigilance of the
      Indians; with hurried marches at sunrise, the thermometer at fifty degrees
      below zero often in winter, and open camps beneath the stars, and no camp
      at all, as often as not, winter and summer; with rough barrack fun and
      parade and drill and guard of prisoners; and with chances now and then to
      pay homage to a woman&rsquo;s face, the Mounted Force grew full of the Spirit of
      the West and became brown, valiant, and hardy, with wind and weather.
      Perhaps some of them longed to touch, oftener than they did, the hands of
      children, and to consider more the faces of women,&mdash;for hearts are
      hearts even under a belted coat of red on the Fiftieth Parallel,&mdash;but
      men of nerve do not blazon their feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one would have accused Sergeant Fones of having a heart. Men of keen
      discernment would have seen in him the little Bismarck of the Mounted
      Police. His name carried farther on the Cypress Hills Patrol than any
      other; and yet his officers could never say that he exceeded his duty or
      enlarged upon the orders he received. He had no sympathy with crime.
      Others of the force might wink at it; but his mind appeared to sit
      severely upright upon the cold platform of Penalty, in beholding breaches
      of the statutes. He would not have rained upon the unjust as the just if
      he had had the directing of the heavens. As Private Gellatly put it:
      &ldquo;Sergeant Fones has the fear o&rsquo; God in his heart, and the law of the land
      across his saddle, and the newest breech-loading at that!&rdquo; He was part of
      the great machine of Order, the servant of Justice, the sentinel in the
      vestibule of Martial Law. His interpretation of duty worked upward as
      downward. Officers and privates were acted on by the force known as
      Sergeant Fones. Some people, like Old Brown Windsor, spoke hardly and
      openly of this force. There were three people who never did&mdash;Pretty
      Pierre, Young Aleck, and Mab Humphrey. Pierre hated him; Young Aleck
      admired in him a quality lying dormant in himself&mdash;decision; Mab
      Humphrey spoke unkindly of no one. Besides&mdash;but no!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Sergeant Fones&rsquo;s country? No one knew. Where had he come from? No
      one asked him more than once. He could talk French with Pierre,&mdash;a
      kind of French that sometimes made the undertone of red in the Frenchman&rsquo;s
      cheeks darker. He had been heard to speak German to a German prisoner, and
      once, when a gang of Italians were making trouble on a line of railway
      under construction, he arrested the leader, and, in a few swift, sharp
      words in the language of the rioters, settled the business. He had no
      accent that betrayed his nationality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been recommended for a commission. The officer in command had
      hinted that the Sergeant might get a Christmas present. The officer had
      further said: &ldquo;And if it was something that both you and the Patrol would
      be the better for, you couldn&rsquo;t object, Sergeant.&rdquo; But the Sergeant only
      saluted, looking steadily into the eyes of the officer. That was his
      reply. Private Gellatly, standing without, heard Sergeant Fones say, as he
      passed into the open air, and slowly bared his forehead to the winter sun:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Private Gellatly cried, with revolt in his voice, &ldquo;Divils me own, the
      word that a&rsquo;t to have been full o&rsquo; joy was like the clip of a
      rifle-breech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Justice in a new country is administered with promptitude and vigour, or
      else not administered at all. Where an officer of the Mounted
      Police-Soldiery has all the powers of a magistrate, the law&rsquo;s delay and
      the insolence of office have little space in which to work. One of the
      commonest slips of virtue in the Canadian West was selling whisky contrary
      to the law of prohibition which prevailed. Whisky runners were land
      smugglers. Old Brown Windsor had, somehow, got the reputation of being
      connected with the whisky runners; not a very respectable business, and
      thought to be dangerous. Whisky runners were inclined to resent intrusion
      on their privacy with a touch of that biting inhospitableness which a
      moonlighter of Kentucky uses toward an inquisitive, unsympathetic marshal.
      On the Cypress Hills Patrol, however, the erring servants of Bacchus were
      having a hard time of it. Vigilance never slept there in the days of which
      these lines bear record. Old Brown Windsor had, in words, freely espoused
      the cause of the sinful. To the careless spectator it seemed a charitable
      siding with the suffering; a proof that the old man&rsquo;s heart was not so
      cold as his hands. Sergeant Fones thought differently, and his mission had
      just been to warn the store-keeper that there was menacing evidence
      gathering against him, and that his friendship with Golden Feather, the
      Indian Chief, had better cease at once. Sergeant Fones had a way of
      putting things. Old Brown Windsor endeavoured for a moment to be
      sarcastic. This was the brief dialogue in the domain of sarcasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you just lit round in a friendly sort of way, hopin&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d
      kenoodle with you later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an unpleasant click to the word. The old man&rsquo;s hands got colder.
      He had nothing more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving, the Sergeant said something quietly and quickly to Young
      Aleck. Pierre observed, but could not hear. Young Aleck was uneasy; Pierre
      was perplexed. The Sergeant turned at the door, and said in French: &ldquo;What
      are your chances for a Merry Christmas at Pardon&rsquo;s Drive, Pretty Pierre?&rdquo;
       Pierre answered nothing. He shrugged his shoulders, and as the door
      closed, muttered, &ldquo;Il est le diable.&rdquo; And he meant it. What should
      Sergeant Fones know of that intended meeting at Pardon&rsquo;s Drive on
      Christmas Day? And if he knew, what then? It was not against the law to
      play euchre. Still it perplexed Pierre. Before the Windsors, father and
      son, however, he was, as we have seen, playfully cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      After quitting Old Brown Windsor&rsquo;s store, Sergeant Fones urged his stout
      broncho to a quicker pace than usual. The broncho was, like himself,
      wasteful of neither action nor affection. The Sergeant had caught him wild
      and independent, had brought him in, broken him, and taught him obedience.
      They understood each other; perhaps they loved each other. But about that
      even Private Gellatly had views in common with the general sentiment as to
      the character of Sergeant Fones. The private remarked once on this point
      &ldquo;Sarpints alive! the heels of the one and the law of the other is the love
      of them. They&rsquo;ll weather together like the Divil and Death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant was brooding; that was not like him. He was hesitating; that
      was less like him. He turned his broncho round as if to cross the Big
      Divide and to go back to Windsor&rsquo;s store; but he changed his mind again,
      and rode on toward David Humphrey&rsquo;s ranch. He sat as if he had been born
      in the saddle. His was a face for the artist, strong and clear, and having
      a dominant expression of force. The eyes were deepset and watchful. A kind
      of disdain might be traced in the curve of the short upper lip, to which
      the moustache was clipped close&mdash;a good fit, like his coat. The
      disdain was more marked this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part of his ride had been seen by Young Aleck, the second part
      by Mab Humphrey. Her first thought on seeing him was one of apprehension
      for Young Aleck and those of Young Aleck&rsquo;s name. She knew that people
      spoke of her lover as a ne&rsquo;er-do-weel; and that they associated his name
      freely with that of Pretty Pierre and his gang. She had a dread of Pierre,
      and, only the night before, she had determined to make one last great
      effort to save Aleck, and if he would not be saved&mdash;strange that,
      thinking it all over again, as she watched the figure on horseback coming
      nearer, her mind should swerve to what she had heard of Sergeant Fones&rsquo;s
      expected promotion. Then she fell to wondering if anyone had ever given
      him a real Christmas present; if he had any friends at all; if life meant
      anything more to him than carrying the law of the land across his saddle.
      Again he suddenly came to her in a new thought, free from apprehension,
      and as the champion of her cause to defeat the half-breed and his gang,
      and save Aleck from present danger or future perils.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was such a woman as prairies nurture; in spirit broad and thoughtful
      and full of energy; not so deep as the mountain woman, not so imaginative,
      but with more persistency, more daring. Youth to her was a warmth, a
      glory. She hated excess and lawlessness, but she could understand it. She
      felt sometimes as if she must go far away into the unpeopled spaces, and
      shriek out her soul to the stars from the fulness of too much life. She
      supposed men had feelings of that kind too, but that they fell to playing
      cards and drinking instead of crying to the stars. Still, she preferred
      her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, Sergeant Fones, on leaving the house, said grimly after his fashion:
      &ldquo;Not Mab but Ariadne&mdash;excuse a soldier&rsquo;s bluntness..... Good-bye!&rdquo;
       and with a brusque salute he had ridden away. What he meant she did not
      know and could not ask. The thought instantly came to her mind: Not
      Sergeant Fones; but who? She wondered if Ariadne was born on the prairie.
      What knew she of the girl who helped Theseus, her lover, to slay the
      Minotaur? What guessed she of the Slopes of Naxos? How old was Ariadne?
      Twenty? For that was Mab&rsquo;s age. Was Ariadne beautiful? She ran her fingers
      loosely through her short brown hair, waving softly about her Greek-shaped
      head, and reasoned that Ariadne must have been presentable, or Sergeant
      Fones would not have made the comparison. She hoped Ariadne could ride
      well, for she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how white the world looked this morning, and how proud and brilliant
      the sky! Nothing in the plane of vision but waves of snow stretching to
      the Cypress Hills; far to the left a solitary house, with its tin roof
      flashing back the sun, and to the right the Big Divide. It was an
      old-fashioned winter, not one in which bare ground and sharp winds make
      life outdoors inhospitable. Snow is hospitable-clean, impacted snow;
      restful and silent. But there was one spot in the area of white, on which
      Mab&rsquo;s eyes were fixed now, with something different in them from what had
      been there. Again it was a memory with which Sergeant Fones was
      associated. One day in the summer just past she had watched him and his
      company put away to rest under the cool sod, where many another lay in
      silent company, a prairie wanderer, some outcast from a better life gone
      by. Afterwards, in her home, she saw the Sergeant stand at the window,
      looking out towards the spot where the waves in the sea of grass were more
      regular and greener than elsewhere, and were surmounted by a high cross.
      She said to him&mdash;for she of all was never shy of his stern ways:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is the grass always greenest there, Sergeant Fones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew what she meant, and slowly said: &ldquo;It is the Barracks of the Free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no views of life save those of duty and work and natural joy and
      loving a ne&rsquo;er-do-weel, and she said: &ldquo;I do not understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Sergeant replied: &ldquo;&lsquo;Free among the Dead like unto them that are
      wounded and lie in the grave, who are out of remembrance.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mab said again: &ldquo;I do not understand that either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant did not at once reply. He stepped to the door and gave a
      short command to some one without, and in a moment his company was mounted
      in line; handsome, dashing fellows; one the son of an English nobleman,
      one the brother of an eminent Canadian politician, one related to a
      celebrated English dramatist. He ran his eye along the line, then turned
      to Mab, raised his cap with machine-like precision, and said: &ldquo;No, I
      suppose you do not understand that. Keep Aleck Windsor from Pretty Pierre
      and his gang. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he mounted and rode away. Every other man in the company looked back
      to where the girl stood in the doorway; he did not. Private Gellatly said,
      with a shake of the head, as she was lost to view: &ldquo;Devils bestir me, what
      a widdy she&rsquo;ll make!&rdquo; It was understood that Aleck Windsor and Mab
      Humphrey were to be married on the coming New Year&rsquo;s Day. What connection
      was there between the words of Sergeant Fones and those of Private
      Gellatly? None, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mab thought upon that day as she looked out, this December morning, and
      saw Sergeant Fones dismounting at the door. David Humphrey, who was
      outside, offered to put up the Sergeant&rsquo;s horse; but he said: &ldquo;No, if
      you&rsquo;ll hold him just a moment, Mr. Humphrey, I&rsquo;ll ask for a drink of
      something warm, and move on. Miss Humphrey is inside, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll give you a drink of the best to be had on your patrol, Sergeant,&rdquo;
       was the laughing reply. &ldquo;Thanks for that, but tea or coffee is good enough
      for me,&rdquo; said the Sergeant. Entering, the coffee was soon in the hand of
      the hardy soldier. Once he paused in his drinking and scanned Mab&rsquo;s face
      closely. Most people would have said the Sergeant had an affair of the law
      in hand, and was searching the face of a criminal; but most people are not
      good at interpretation. Mab was speaking to the chore-girl at the same
      time and did not see the look. If she could have defined her thoughts when
      she, in turn, glanced into the Sergeant&rsquo;s face, a moment afterwards, she
      would have said, &ldquo;Austerity fills this man. Isolation marks him for its
      own.&rdquo; In the eyes were only purpose, decision, and command. Was that the
      look that had been fixed upon her face a moment ago? It must have been.
      His features had not changed a breath. Mab began their talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say you are to get a Christmas present of promotion, Sergeant
      Fones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen it gazetted,&rdquo; he answered enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and your friends will be glad of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have more freedom with a commission.&rdquo; He made no reply, but rose
      and walked to the window, and looked out across the snow, drawing on his
      gauntlets as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that he was looking where the grass in summer was the greenest!
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to barracks now. I suppose Young Aleck will be in quarters
      here on Christmas Day, Miss Mab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; and she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say he would be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked toward the coffee. Then: &ldquo;Thank you.....Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Humphrey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not come to us on Christmas Day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyelids closed swiftly and opened again. &ldquo;I shall be on duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And promoted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And merry and happy?&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled to herself to think of Sergeant
      Fones being merry and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word suited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment with his fingers on the latch, and turned round as if
      to speak; pulled off his gauntlet, and then as quickly put it on again.
      Had he meant to offer his hand in good-bye? He had never been seen to take
      the hand of anyone except with the might of the law visible in steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door with the right hand, but turned round as he stepped
      out, so that the left held it while he faced the warmth of the room and
      the face of the girl. The door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounted, and having said good-bye to Mr. Humphrey, he turned towards the
      house, raised his cap with soldierly brusqueness, and rode away in the
      direction of the barracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not watch him. She was thinking of Young Aleck, and of
      Christmas Day, now near. The Sergeant did not look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the party at Windsor&rsquo;s store was broken up. Pretty Pierre and
      Young Aleck had talked together, and the old man had heard his son say:
      &ldquo;Remember, Pierre, it is for the last time.&rdquo; Then they talked after this
      fashion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I know, &lsquo;mon ami;&rsquo; for the last time! &lsquo;Eh, bien,&rsquo; you will spend
      Christmas Day with us too&mdash;no? You surely will not leave us on the
      day of good fortune? Where better can you take your pleasure for the last
      time? One day is not enough for farewell. Two, three; that is the magic
      number. You will, eh? no? Well, well, you will come to-morrow&mdash;and&mdash;eh,
      &lsquo;mon ami,&rsquo; where do you go the next day? Oh, &lsquo;pardon,&rsquo; I forgot, you spend
      the Christmas Day&mdash;I know. And the day of the New Year? Ah, Young
      Aleck, that is what they say&mdash;the devil for the devil&rsquo;s luck. So.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that, Pierre.&rdquo; There was fierceness in the tone. &ldquo;I spend the
      Christmas Day where you don&rsquo;t, and as I like, and the rest doesn&rsquo;t concern
      you. I drink with you, I play with you&mdash;&lsquo;bien!&rsquo; As you say yourself,
      &lsquo;bien,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon!&rsquo; We will not quarrel. No; we spend not the Christmas Day after
      the same fashion, quite. Then, to-morrow at Pardon&rsquo;s Drive! Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre went out of one door, a malediction between his white teeth,
      and Aleck went out of another door with a malediction upon his gloomy
      lips. But both maledictions were levelled at the same person. Poor Aleck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Aleck!&rdquo; That is the way we sometimes think of a good nature gone
      awry; one that has learned to say cruel maledictions to itself, and
      against which demons hurl their deadly maledictions too. Alas, for the
      ne&rsquo;er-do-weel!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night a stalwart figure passed from David Humphrey&rsquo;s door, carrying
      with him the warm atmosphere of a good woman&rsquo;s love. The chilly outer air
      of the world seemed not to touch him, Love&rsquo;s curtains were drawn so close.
      Had one stood within &ldquo;the Hunter&rsquo;s Room,&rdquo; as it was called, a little while
      before, one would have seen a man&rsquo;s head bowed before a woman, and her
      hand smoothing back the hair from the handsome brow where dissipation had
      drawn some deep lines. Presently the hand raised the head until the eyes
      of the woman looked full into the eyes of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go to Pardon&rsquo;s Drive again, will you, Aleck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never again after Christmas Day, Mab. But I must go to-morrow. I have
      given my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. To meet Pretty Pierre and all the rest, and for what? Oh, Aleck,
      isn&rsquo;t the suspicion about your father enough, but you must put this on me
      as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father must suffer for his wrong-doing if he does wrong, and I for
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. He bowed his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have done wrong to us both. Forgive me, Mab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over and caressed his hair. &ldquo;I forgive you, Aleck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thousand new thoughts were thrilling through him. Yet this man had given
      his word to do that for which he must ask forgiveness of the woman he
      loved. But to Pretty Pierre, forgiven or unforgiven, he would keep his
      word. She understood it better than most of those who read this brief
      record can. Every sphere has its code of honour and duty peculiar to
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come to me on Christmas morning, Aleck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come on Christmas morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no more after that of Pretty Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no more of Pretty Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She trusted him; but neither could reckon with unknown forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Fones, sitting in the barracks in talk with Private Gellatly,
      said at that moment in a swift silence, &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre, at Pardon&rsquo;s Drive, drinking a glass of brandy at that
      moment, said to the ceiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of Pretty Pierre after to-morrow night, monsieur! Bien! If it is
      for the last time, then it is for the last time. So....so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. His teeth were amazingly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stalwart figure strode on under the stars, the white night a lens for
      visions of days of rejoicing to come. All evil was far from him. The
      dolorous tide rolled back in this hour from his life, and he revelled in
      the light of a new day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve played my last card to-morrow night with Pretty Pierre, I&rsquo;ll
      begin the world again,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sergeant Fones in the barracks said just then, in response to a
      further remark of Private Gellatly,&mdash;&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Aleck fell to singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Out from your vineland come
            Into the prairies wild;
          Here will we make our home,
            Father, mother, and child;
          Come, my love, to our home,
            Father, mother, and child,
            Father, mother, and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He fell to thinking again&mdash;&ldquo;and child&mdash;and child,&rdquo;&mdash;it was
      in his ears and in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pretty Pierre was singing softly to himself in the room at Pardon&rsquo;s
      Drive:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Three good friends with the wine at night
          Vive la compagnie!
        Two good friends when the sun grows bright
          Vive la compagnie!
          Vive la, vive la, vive l&rsquo;amour!
          Vive la, vive la, vive l&rsquo;amour!
        Three good friends, two good friends
          Vive la compagnie!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Gellatly was cousin to Idaho Jack, and Idaho Jack disliked Pretty
      Pierre, though he had been one of the gang. The cousins had seen each
      other lately, and Private Gellatly had had a talk with the man who was
      ha&rsquo;sh. It may be that others besides Pierre had an idea of what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house at Pardon&rsquo;s Drive the next night sat eight men, of whom three
      were Pretty Pierre, Young Aleck, and Idaho Jack. Young Aleck&rsquo;s face was
      flushed with bad liquor and the worse excitement of play. This was one of
      the unreckoned forces. Was this the man that sang the tender song under
      the stars last night? Pretty Pierre&rsquo;s face was less pretty than usual; the
      cheeks were pallid, the eyes were hard and cold. Once he looked at his
      partner as if to say, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Idaho Jack saw the look; he glanced at
      his watch; it was eleven o&rsquo;clock. At that moment the door opened, and
      Sergeant Fones entered. All started to their feet, most with curses on
      their lips; but Sergeant Fones never seemed to hear anything that could
      make a feature of his face alter. Pierre&rsquo;s hand was on his hip, as if
      feeling for something. Sergeant Fones saw that; but he walked to where
      Aleck stood, with his unplayed cards still in his hand, and, laying a hand
      on his shoulder, said, &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I go with you?&rdquo;&mdash;this with a drunken man&rsquo;s bravado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre stepped forward. &ldquo;What is his crime?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does that concern you, Pretty Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he your friend, Aleck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was there in the eyes of Sergeant Fones that forced the reply,&mdash;&ldquo;To-night,
      yes; to-morrow, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. It is near to-morrow; come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aleck was led towards the door. Once more Pierre&rsquo;s hand went to his hip;
      but he was looking at the prisoner, not at the Sergeant. The Sergeant saw,
      and his fingers were at his belt. He opened the door. Aleck passed out. He
      followed. Two horses were tied to a post. With difficulty Aleck was
      mounted. Once on the way his brain began slowly to clear, but he grew
      painfully cold. It was a bitter night. How bitter it might have been for
      the ne&rsquo;er-do-weel let the words of Idaho Jack, spoken in a long hour&rsquo;s
      talk next day with Old Brown Windsor, show. &ldquo;Pretty Pierre, after the two
      were gone, said, with a shiver of curses,&mdash;&lsquo;Another hour and it would
      have been done, and no one to blame. He was ready for trouble. His money
      was nearly finished. A little quarrel easily made, the door would open,
      and he would pass out. His horse would be gone, he could not come back; he
      would walk. The air is cold, quite, quite cold; and the snow is a soft
      bed. He would sleep well and sound, having seen Pretty Pierre for the last
      time. And now&mdash;&rsquo; The rest was French and furtive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that hour Idaho Jack and Pretty Pierre parted company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding from Pardon&rsquo;s Drive, Young Aleck noticed at last that they were not
      going towards the barracks. He said: &ldquo;Why do you arrest me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant replied: &ldquo;You will know that soon enough. You are now going
      to your own home. Tomorrow you will keep your word and go to David
      Humphrey&rsquo;s place; the next day I will come for you. Which do you choose:
      to ride with me to-night to the barracks and know why you are arrested, or
      go, unknowing, as I bid you, and keep your word with the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through Aleck&rsquo;s fevered brain, there ran the words of the song he sang
      before&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Out from your vineland come
            Into the prairies wild;
          Here will we make our home,
            Father, mother, and child.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He could have but one answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of his home the Sergeant left him with the words, &ldquo;Remember
      you are on parole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aleck noticed as the Sergeant rode away that the face of the sky had
      changed, and slight gusts of wind had come up. At any other time his mind
      would have dwelt upon the fact. It did not do so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Day came. People said that the fiercest night, since the
      blizzard day of 1863, had been passed. But the morning was clear and
      beautiful. The sun came up like a great flower expanding. First the
      yellow, then the purple, then the red, and then a mighty shield of roses.
      The world was a blanket of drift, and down, and glistening silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mab Humphrey greeted her lover with such a smile as only springs to a
      thankful woman&rsquo;s lips. He had given his word and had kept it; and the path
      of the future seemed surer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a prisoner on parole; still that did not depress him. Plans for
      coming days were talked of, and the laughter of many voices filled the
      house. The ne&rsquo;er-do-weel was clothed and in his right mind. In the
      Hunter&rsquo;s Room the noblest trophy was the heart of a repentant prodigal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the barracks that morning a gazetted notice was posted, announcing,
      with such technical language as is the custom, that Sergeant Fones was
      promoted to be a lieutenant in the Mounted Police Force of the North West
      Territory. When the officer in command sent for him he could not be found.
      But he was found that morning; and when Private Gellatly, with a warm
      hand, touching the glove of &ldquo;iron and ice&rdquo; that, indeed, now said:
      &ldquo;Sergeant Fones, you are promoted, God help you!&rdquo; he gave no sign.
      Motionless, stern, erect, he sat there upon his horse, beside a stunted
      larch tree. The broncho seemed to understand, for he did not stir, and had
      not done so for hours;&mdash;they could tell that. The bridle rein was
      still in the frigid fingers, and a smile was upon the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile upon the face of Sergeant Fones!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he smiled that he was going to the Barracks of the Free&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free among the Dead like unto them that are wounded and lie in the grave,
      that are out of remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the wild night he had lost his way, though but a few miles from the
      barracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done his duty rigidly in that sphere of life where he had lived so
      much alone among his many comrades. Had he exceeded his duty once in
      arresting Young Aleck?
    </p>
    <p>
      When, the next day, Sergeant Fones lay in the barracks, over him the flag
      for which he had sworn to do honest service, and his promotion papers in
      his quiet hand, the two who loved each other stood beside him for many a
      throbbing minute. And one said to herself, silently: &ldquo;I felt sometimes&rdquo;&mdash;but
      no more words did she say even to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Aleck came in, and walked to where the Sergeant slept, wrapped close
      in that white frosted coverlet which man wears but once. He stood for a
      moment silent, his fingers numbly clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Gellatly spoke softly: &ldquo;Angels betide me, it&rsquo;s little we knew the
      great of him till he wint away; the pride, and the law&mdash;and the love
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the tragedy that faced them this Christmas morning one at least had
      seen &ldquo;the love of him.&rdquo; Perhaps the broncho had known it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Aleck laid a palm upon the hand he had never touched when it had life.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;too&mdash;ha&rsquo;sh,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Gellatly looked up wonderingly. But the old man&rsquo;s eyes were wet.

    <h2>
      GOD&rsquo;S GARRISON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Twenty years ago there was trouble at Fort o&rsquo; God. &ldquo;Out of this place we
      get betwixt the suns,&rdquo; said Gyng the Factor. &ldquo;No help that falls abaft
      tomorrow could save us. Food dwindles, and ammunition&rsquo;s nearly gone, and
      they&rsquo;ll have the cold steel in our scalp-locks if we stay. We&rsquo;ll creep
      along the Devil&rsquo;s Causeway, then through the Red Horn Woods, and so across
      the plains to Rupert House. Whip in the dogs, Baptiste, and be ready all
      of you at midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Grah the Idiot&mdash;what of him&rdquo;? asked Pretty Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to take his chance. If he can travel with us, so much the
      better for him&rdquo;; and the Factor shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, so much the worse, eh&rdquo;? returned Pretty Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work the sum out to suit yourself. We&rsquo;ve got our necks to save. God&rsquo;ll
      have to help the Idiot if we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, Grah Hamon, Idiot,&rdquo; said Pierre an hour afterwards, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
      going to leave Fort o&rsquo; God and make for Rupert House. You&rsquo;ve a dragging
      leg, you&rsquo;re gone in the savvy, you have to balance yourself with your
      hands as you waddle along, and you slobber when you talk; but you&rsquo;ve got
      to cut away with us quick across the Beaver Plains, and Christ&rsquo;ll have to
      help you if we can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s what the Factor says, and that&rsquo;s how the case
      stands, Idiot&mdash;&lsquo;bien?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grah want pipe&mdash;bubble&mdash;bubble&mdash;wind blow,&rdquo; muttered the
      daft one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre bent over and said slowly: &ldquo;If you stay here, Grah, the
      Indian get your scalp; if you go, the snow is deep and the frost is like a
      badger&rsquo;s tooth, and you can&rsquo;t be carried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Oh!&mdash;my mother dead&mdash;poor Annie&mdash;by God, Grah want
      pipe&mdash;poor Grah sleep in snow-bubble, bubble&mdash;Oh, Oh!&mdash;the
      long wind, fly away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre watched the great head of the Idiot as it swung heavily on
      his shoulders, and then said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Mais,&rsquo; like that, so!&rdquo; and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the party were about to sally forth on their perilous path to safety,
      Gyng stood and cried angrily: &ldquo;Well, why hasn&rsquo;t some one bundled up that
      moth-eaten Caliban? Curse it all, must I do everything myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; said Pierre, &ldquo;the Caliban stays at Fort o&rsquo; God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a Christian heart in you, so help me, Heaven!&rdquo; replied the
      other. &ldquo;No, sir, we give him a chance,&mdash;and his Maker too for that
      matter, to show what He&rsquo;s willing to do for His misfits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre rejoined, &ldquo;Well, I have thought. The game is all against
      Grah if he go; but there are two who stay at Fort o&rsquo; God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that is how, when the Factor and his half-breeds and trappers stole
      away in silence towards the Devil&rsquo;s Causeway, Pierre and the Idiot
      remained behind. And that is why the flag of the H. B. C. still flew above
      Fort o&rsquo; God in the New Year&rsquo;s sun just twenty years ago to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company had never done a worse day&rsquo;s work than when they
      promoted Gyng to be chief factor. He loathed the heathen and he showed his
      loathing. He had a heart harder than iron, a speech that bruised worse
      than the hoof of an angry moose. And when at last he drove away a band of
      wandering Sioux, foodless, from the stores, siege and ambush took the
      place of prayer, and a nasty portion fell to Fort o&rsquo; God. For the Indians
      found a great cache of buffalo meat, and, having sent the women and
      children south with the old men, gave constant and biting assurances to
      Gyng that the heathen hath his hour, even though he be a dog which is
      refused those scraps from the white man&rsquo;s table which give life in the
      hour of need. Besides all else, there was in the Fort the thing which the
      gods made last to humble the pride of men&mdash;there was rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the morning after Gyng and his men had departed, because it was a day
      when frost was master of the sun, and men grew wild for action, since to
      stand still was to face indignant Death, they, who camped without,
      prepared to make a sally upon the wooden gates. Pierre saw their intent,
      and hid in the ground some pemmican and all the scanty rum. Then he looked
      at his powder and shot, and saw that there was little left. If he spent it
      on the besiegers, how should they fare for beast and fowl in hungry days?
      And for his rifle he had but a brace of bullets. He rolled these in his
      hand, looking upon them with a grim smile. And the Idiot, seeing, rose and
      sidled towards him, and said: &ldquo;Poor Grah want pipe&mdash;bubble&mdash;bubble.&rdquo;
       Then a light of childish cunning came into his eyes, and he touched the
      bullets blunderingly, and continued: &ldquo;Plenty, plenty b&rsquo;longs Grah&mdash;give
      poor Grah pipe&mdash;plenty, plenty, give you these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pretty Pierre after a moment replied: &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, Grah?&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      got bullets stowed away? Well, I must have them. It&rsquo;s a one-sided game in
      which you get the tricks; but here&rsquo;s the pipe, Idiot&mdash;my only pipe
      for your dribbling mouth&mdash;my last good comrade. Now show me the
      bullets. Take me to them, daft one, quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later the Idiot sat inside the store, wrapped in loose furs, and
      blowing bubbles; while Pretty Pierre, with many handfuls of bullets by
      him, waited for the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; he said, as he watched from a loophole, &ldquo;Gyng and the others have
      got safely past the Causeway, and the rest is possible. Well, it hurts an
      idiot as much to die, perhaps, as a half-breed or a factor. It is good to
      stay here. If we fight, and go out swift like Grah&rsquo;s bubbles, it is the
      game. If we starve and sleep as did Grah&rsquo;s mother, then it also is the
      game. It is great to have all the chances against and then to win. We
      shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp relish in his eye he watched the enemy coming slowly forward.
      Yet he talked almost idly to himself: &ldquo;I have a thought of so long ago. A
      woman&mdash;she was a mother, and it was on the Madawaska River, and she
      said: &lsquo;Sometimes I think a devil was your father, an angel sometimes. You
      were begot in an hour between a fighting and a mass: between blood and
      heaven. And when you were born you made no cry. They said that was a sign
      of evil. You refused the breast, and drank only of the milk of wild
      cattle. In baptism you flung your hand before your face that the water
      might not touch, nor the priest&rsquo;s finger make a cross upon the water. And
      they said it were better if you had been born an idiot than with an evil
      spirit; and that your hand would be against the loins that bore you. But
      Pierre, ah Pierre, you love your mother, do you not?&rsquo;&rdquo; ... And he standing
      now, his eye closed with the gate-chink in front of Fort o&rsquo; God, said
      quietly: &ldquo;She was of the race that hated these&mdash;my mother; and she
      died of a wound they gave her at the Tete Blanche Hill. Well, for that you
      die now, Yellow Arm, if this gun has a bullet cold enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bullet pinged through the sharp air, as the Indians swarmed towards the
      gate, and Yellow Arm, the chief, fell. The besiegers paused; and then, as
      if at the command of the fallen man, they drew back, bearing him to the
      camp, where they sat down and mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre watched them for a time; and, seeing that they made no further
      move, retired into the store, where the Idiot muttered and was happy after
      his kind. &ldquo;Grah got pipe&mdash;blow away&mdash;blow away to Annie&mdash;pretty
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Grah, there&rsquo;s chance enough that you&rsquo;ll blow away to Annie pretty
      soon,&rdquo; remarked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grah have white eagles&mdash;fly, fly on the wind&mdash;oh, oh, bubble,
      bubble!&rdquo; and he sent the filmy globes floating from the pipe that a camp
      of river-drivers had given the half-breed winters before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre stood and looked at the wandering eyes, behind which were the
      torturings of an immense and confused intelligence; a life that fell
      deformed before the weight of too much brain, so that all tottered from
      the womb into the gutters of foolishness, and the tongue mumbled of chaos
      when it should have told marvellous things. And the half-breed, the
      thought of this coming upon him, said: &ldquo;Well, I think the matters of hell
      have fallen across the things of heaven, and there is storm. If for one
      moment he could think clear, it would be great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bethought him of a certain chant, taught him by a medicine man in
      childhood, which, sung to the waving of a torch in a place of darkness,
      caused evil spirits to pass from those possessed, and good spirits to
      reign in their stead. And he raised the Idiot to his feet, and brought
      him, maundering, to a room where no light was. He kneeled before him with
      a lighted torch of bear&rsquo;s fat and the tendons of the deer, and waving it
      gently to and fro, sang the ancient rune, until the eye of the Idiot,
      following the torch at a tangent as it waved, suddenly became fixed upon
      the flame, when it ceased to move. And the words of the chant ran through
      Grah&rsquo;s ears, and pierced to the remote parts of his being; and a sickening
      trouble came upon his face, and the lips ceased to drip, and were caught
      up in twinges of pain.... The chant rolled on: &ldquo;Go forth, go forth upon
      them, thou, the Scarlet Hunter! Drive them forth into the wilds, drive
      them crying forth! Enter in, O enter in, and lie upon the couch of peace,
      the couch of peace within my wigwam, thou the wise one! Behold, I call to
      thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pierre, looking upon the Idiot, saw his face glow, and his eye stream
      steadily to the light, and he said, &ldquo;What is it that you see, Grah?&mdash;speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All pitifulness and struggle had gone from the Idiot&rsquo;s face, and a strong
      calm fell upon it, and the voice of a man that God had created spoke
      slowly: &ldquo;There is an end of blood. The great chief Yellow Arm is fallen.
      He goeth to the plains where his wife will mourn upon his knees, and his
      children cry, because he that gathered food is gone, and the pots are
      empty on the fire. And they who follow him shall fight no more. Two shall
      live through bitter days, and when the leaves shall shine in the sun
      again, there shall good things befal. But one shall go upon a long journey
      with the singing birds in the path of the white eagle. He shall travel,
      and not cease until he reach the place where fools, and children, and they
      into whom a devil entered through the gates of birth, find the mothers who
      bore them. But the other goeth at a different time&mdash;&rdquo; At this point
      the light in Pretty Pierre&rsquo;s hand flickered and went out, and through the
      darkness there came a voice, the voice of an idiot, that whimpered: &ldquo;Grah
      want pipe&mdash;Annie, Annie dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The angel of wisdom was gone, and chaos spluttered on the lolling lips
      again; the Idiot sat feeling for the pipe that he had dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      And never again through the days that came and went could Pierre, by any
      conjuring, or any swaying torch, make the fool into a man again. The
      devils of confusion were returned forever. But there had been one glimpse
      of the god. And it was as the Idiot had said when he saw with the eyes of
      that god: no more blood was shed. The garrison of this fort held it
      unmolested. The besiegers knew not that two men only stayed within the
      walls; and because the chief begged to be taken south to die, they left
      the place surrounded by its moats of ice and its trenches of famine; and
      they came not back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But other foes more deadly than the angry heathen came, and they were
      called Hunger and Loneliness. The one destroyeth the body and the other
      the brain. But Grah was not lonely, nor did he hunger. He blew his
      bubbles, and muttered of a wind whereon a useless thing&mdash;a film of
      water, a butterfly, or a fool&mdash;might ride beyond the reach of spirit,
      or man, or heathen. His flesh remained the same, and grew not less; but
      that of Pierre wasted, and his eye grew darker with suffering. For man is
      only man, and hunger is a cruel thing. To give one&rsquo;s food to feed a fool,
      and to search the silent plains in vain for any living thing to kill, is a
      matter for angels to do and bear, and not mere mortals. But this man had a
      strength of his own like to his code of living, which was his own and not
      another&rsquo;s. And at last, when spring leaped gaily forth from the grey cloak
      of winter, and men of the H. B. C. came to relieve Fort o&rsquo; God, and
      entered at its gates, a gaunt man, leaning on his rifle, greeted them
      standing like a warrior, though his body was like that of one who had lain
      in the grave. He answered to the name of Pierre without pride, but like a
      man and not as a sick woman. And huddled on the floor beside him was an
      idiot fondling a pipe, with a shred of pemmican at his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in irony of man&rsquo;s sacrifice, the All Hail and the Master of Things
      permitted the fool to fulfil his own prophecy, and die of a sudden
      sickness in the coming-on of summer. But he of God&rsquo;s Garrison that
      remained repented not of his deed. Such men have no repentance, neither of
      good nor evil.

    <h2>
      A HAZARD OF THE NORTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nobody except Gregory Thorne and myself knows the history of the Man and
      Woman, who lived on the Height of Land, just where Dog Ear River falls
      into Marigold Lake. This portion of the Height of Land is a lonely
      country. The sun marches over it distantly, and the man of the East&mdash;the
      braggart&mdash;calls it outcast; but animals love it; and the shades of
      the long-gone trapper and &lsquo;voyageur&rsquo; saunter without mourning through its
      fastnesses. When you are in doubt, trust God&rsquo;s dumb creatures&mdash;and
      the happy dead who whisper pleasant promptings to us, and whose knowledge
      is mighty. Besides, the Man and Woman lived there, and Gregory Thorne says
      that they could recover a lost paradise. But Gregory Thorne is an insolent
      youth. The names of these people were John and Audrey Malbrouck; the Man
      was known to the makers of backwoods history as Captain John. Gregory says
      about that&mdash;but no, not yet!&mdash;let his first meeting with the Man
      and the Woman be described in his own words, unusual and flippant as they
      sometimes are; for though he is a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge,
      and a brother of a Right Honourable, he has conceived it his duty to
      emancipate himself in the matter of style in language; and he has
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was autumn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all colours; beautiful and nippy on the Height
      of Land; wild ducks, the which no man could number, and bear&rsquo;s meat abroad
      in the world. I was alone. I had hunted all day, leaving my mark now and
      then as I journeyed, with a cache of slaughter here, and a blazed hickory
      there. I was hungry as a circus tiger&mdash;did you ever eat slippery elm
      bark?&mdash;yes, I was as bad as that. I guessed from what I had been
      told, that the Malbrouck show must be hereaway somewhere. I smelled the
      lake miles off&mdash;oh, you could too if you were half the animal I am; I
      followed my nose and the slippery-elm between my teeth, and came at a
      double-quick suddenly on the fair domain. There the two sat in front of
      the house like turtle-doves, and as silent as a middy after his first
      kiss. Much as I ached to get my tooth into something filling, I wished
      that I had &lsquo;em under my pencil, with that royal sun making a rainbow of
      the lake, the woods all scarlet and gold, and that mist of purple&mdash;eh,
      you&rsquo;ve seen it?&mdash;and they sitting there monarchs of it all, like that
      duffer of a king who had operas played for his solitary benefit. But I
      hadn&rsquo;t a pencil and I had a hunger, and I said &lsquo;How!&rsquo; like any other Injin&mdash;insolent,
      wasn&rsquo;t it? Then the Man rose, and he said I was welcome, and she smiled an
      approving but not very immediate smile, and she kept her seat,&mdash;she
      kept her seat, my boy,&mdash;and that was the first thing that set me
      thinking. She didn&rsquo;t seem to be conscious that there was before her one of
      the latest representatives from Belgravia, not she! But when I took an
      honest look at her face, I understood. I&rsquo;m glad that I had my hat in my
      hand, polite as any Frenchman on the threshold of a blanchisserie: for I
      learned very soon that the Woman had been in Belgravia too, and knew far
      more than I did about what was what. When she did rise to array the supper
      table, it struck me that if Josephine Beauharnais had been like her, she
      might have kept her hold on Napoleon, and saved his fortunes; made Europe
      France; and France the world. I could not understand it. Jimmy Haldane had
      said to me when I was asking for Malbrouck&rsquo;s place on the compass,&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      put on any side with them, my Greg, or you&rsquo;ll take a day off for
      penitence.&rsquo; They were both tall and good to look at, even if he was a bit
      rugged, with neck all wire and muscle, and had big knuckles. But she had
      hands like those in a picture of Velasquez, with a warm whiteness and
      educated&mdash;that&rsquo;s it, educated hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t young, but she seemed so. Her eyes looked up and out at you
      earnestly, yet not inquisitively, and more occupied with something in her
      mind, than with what was before her. In short, she was a lady; not one by
      virtue of a visit to the gods that rule o&rsquo;er Buckingham Palace, but by the
      claims of good breeding and long descent. She puzzled me, eluded me&mdash;she
      reminded me of someone; but who? Someone I liked, because I felt a thrill
      of admiration whenever I looked at her&mdash;but it was no use, I couldn&rsquo;t
      remember. I soon found myself talking to her according to St. James&mdash;the
      palace, you know&mdash;and at once I entered a bet with my beloved aunt,
      the dowager&mdash;who never refuses to take my offer, though she seldom
      wins, and she&rsquo;s ten thousand miles away, and has to take my word for it&mdash;that
      I should find out the history of this Man and Woman before another
      Christmas morning, which wasn&rsquo;t more than two months off. You know whether
      or not I won it, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had frequently hinted to Gregory that I was old enough to be his father,
      and that in calling me his son, his language was misplaced; and I repeated
      it at that moment. He nodded good-humouredly, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born insolent, my s&mdash;my ancestor. Well, after I had cleared a
      space at the supper table, and had, with permission, lighted my pipe, I
      began to talk... Oh yes, I did give them a chance occasionally; don&rsquo;t
      interrupt.... I gossiped about England, France, the universe. From the
      brief comments they made I saw they knew all about it, and understood my
      social argot, all but a few words&mdash;is there anything peculiar about
      any of my words? After having exhausted Europe and Asia I discussed
      America; talked about Quebec, the folklore of the French Canadians, the
      &lsquo;voyageurs&rsquo; from old Maisonneuve down. All the history I knew I rallied,
      and was suddenly bowled out. For Malbrouck followed my trail from the time
      I began to talk, and in ten minutes he had proved me to be a baby in
      knowledge, an emaciated baby; he eliminated me from the equation. He first
      tripped me on the training of naval cadets; then on the Crimea; then on
      the taking of Quebec; then on the Franco-Prussian War; then, with a sudden
      round-up, on India. I had been trusting to vague outlines of history; I
      felt when he began to talk that I was dealing with a man who not only knew
      history, but had lived it. He talked in the fewest but directest words,
      and waxed eloquent in a blunt and colossal way. But seeing his wife&rsquo;s eyes
      fixed on him intently, he suddenly pulled up, and no more did I get from
      him on the subject. He stopped so suddenly that in order to help over the
      awkwardness, though I&rsquo;m not really sure there was any, I began to hum a
      song to myself. Now, upon my soul, I didn&rsquo;t think what I was humming; it
      was some subterranean association of things, I suppose&mdash;but that
      doesn&rsquo;t matter here. I only state it to clear myself of any unnecessary
      insolence. These were the words I was maundering with this noble voice of
      mine:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;&lsquo;The news I bring, fair Lady,
        Will make your tears run down

        Put off your rose-red dress so fine
        And doff your satin gown!

        Monsieur Malbrouck is dead, alas!
        And buried, too, for aye;

        I saw four officers who bore
        His mighty corse away.
       .............
        We saw above the laurels,
        His soul fly forth amain.

        And each one fell upon his face
        And then rose up again.

        And so we sang the glories,
        For which great Malbrouck bled;
        Mironton, Mironton, Mirontaine,
        Great Malbrouck, he is dead.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt the silence grow peculiar, uncomfortable. I looked up. Mrs.
      Malbrouck was rising to her feet with a look in her face that would make
      angels sorry&mdash;a startled, sorrowful thing that comes from a sleeping
      pain. What an ass I was! Why, the Man&rsquo;s name was Malbrouck; her name was
      Malbrouck&mdash;awful insolence! But surely there was something in the
      story of the song itself that had moved her. As I afterward knew, that was
      it. Malbrouck sat still and unmoved, though I thought I saw something
      stern and masterful in his face as he turned to me; but again instantly
      his eyes were bent on his wife with a comforting and affectionate
      expression. She disappeared into the house. Hoping to make it appear that
      I hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything, I dropped my voice a little and went on,
      intending, however, to stop at the end of the verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;&lsquo;Malbrouck has gone a-fighting,
        Mironton, Mironton, Mirontaine!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ended there; because Malbrouck&rsquo;s heavy hand was laid on my shoulder,
      and he said: &lsquo;If you please, not that song.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect I acted like an idiot. I stammered out apologies, went down on
      my litanies, figuratively speaking, and was all the same confident that my
      excuses were making bad infernally worse. But somehow the old chap had
      taken a liking to me.&mdash;No, of course you couldn&rsquo;t understand that.
      Not that he was so old, you know; but he had the way of retired royalty
      about him, as if he had lived life up to the hilt, and was all pulse and
      granite. Then he began to talk in his quiet way about hunting and fishing;
      about stalking in the Highlands and tiger-hunting in India; and wound up
      with some wonderful stuff about moose-hunting, the sport of Canada. This
      made me itch like sin, just to get my fingers on a trigger, with a full
      moose-yard in view. I can feel it now&mdash;the bound in the blood as I
      caught at Malbrouck&rsquo;s arm and said: &lsquo;By George, I must kill moose; that&rsquo;s
      sport for Vikings, and I was meant to be a Viking&mdash;or a gladiator.&rsquo; 
      Malbrouck at once replied that he would give me some moose-hunting in
      December if I would come up to Marigold Lake. I couldn&rsquo;t exactly reply on
      the instant, because, you see, there wasn&rsquo;t much chance for board and
      lodging thereabouts, unless&mdash;but he went on to say that I should make
      his house my &lsquo;public,&rsquo; perhaps he didn&rsquo;t say it quite in those terms, that
      he and his wife would be glad to have me. With a couple of Indians we
      could go north-west, where the moose-yards were, and have some sport both
      exciting and prodigious. Well, I&rsquo;m a muff, I know, but I didn&rsquo;t refuse
      that. Besides, I began to see the safe side of the bet I had made with my
      aunt, the dowager, and I was more than pleased with what had come to pass
      so far. Lucky for you, too, you yarn-spinner, that the thing did develop
      so, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be getting fame and shekels out of the results of my
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got one thing out of the night&rsquo;s experience; and it was that the
      Malbroucks were no plebs., that they had had their day where plates are
      blue and gold and the spoons are solid coin. But what had sent them up
      here among the moose, the Indians, and the conies&mdash;whatever THEY are?
      How should I get at it? Insolence, you say? Yes, that. I should come up
      here in December, and I should mulct my aunt in the price of a new
      breech-loader. But I found out nothing the next morning, and I left with a
      paternal benediction from Malbrouck, and a smile from his wife that sent
      my blood tingling as it hadn&rsquo;t tingled since a certain season in London,
      which began with my tuneful lyre sounding hopeful numbers and ended with
      it hanging on the willows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I thought it all over, as I trudged back on yesterday&rsquo;s track, I
      concluded that I had told them all my history from my youth up until now,
      and had got nothing from them in return. I had exhausted my family
      records, bit by bit, like a curate in his first parish; and had gone so
      far as to testify that one of my ancestors had been banished to Australia
      for political crimes. Distinctly they had me at an advantage, though, to
      be sure, I had betrayed Mrs. Malbrouck into something more than a
      suspicion of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got back to my old camp, I could find out nothing from the other
      fellows; but Jacques Pontiac told me that his old mate, Pretty Pierre, who
      in recent days had fallen from grace, knew something of these people that
      no one else guessed, because he had let them a part of his house in the
      parish of St. Genevieve in Quebec, years before. Pierre had testified to
      one fact, that a child&mdash;a girl&mdash;had been born to Mrs. Malbrouck
      in his house, but all further knowledge he had withheld. Pretty Pierre was
      off in the Rocky Mountains practising his profession&mdash;chiefly poker&mdash;and
      was not available for information. What did I, Gregory Thorne, want of the
      information anyway? That&rsquo;s the point, my son. Judging from
      after-developments I suppose it was what the foolish call occult sympathy.
      Well, where was that girl-child? Jacques Pontiac didn&rsquo;t know. Nobody knew.
      And I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of Mrs. Malbrouck&rsquo;s face; it haunted me; the broad
      brow, deep eyes, and high-bred sweetness&mdash;all beautifully animal.
      Don&rsquo;t laugh: I find astonishing likenesses between the perfectly human and
      the perfectly animal. Did you never see how beautiful and modest the faces
      of deer are; how chic and sensitive is the manner of a hound; nor the
      keen, warm look in the eye of a well-bred mare? Why, I&rsquo;d rather be a good
      horse of blood and temper than half the fellows I know. You are not an
      animal lover as I am; yes, even when I shoot them or fight them I admire
      them, just as I&rsquo;d admire a swordsman who, in &lsquo;quart,&rsquo; would give me death
      by the wonderful upper thrust. It&rsquo;s all a battle; all a game of love and
      slaughter, my son, and both go together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I say, her face followed me. Watch how the thing developed. By
      the prairie-track I went over to Fort Desire, near the Rockies, almost
      immediately after this, to see about buying a ranch with my old chum at
      Trinity, Polly Cliffshawe&mdash;Polydore, you know. Whom should I meet in
      a hut on the ranch but Jacques&rsquo;s friend, Pretty Pierre. This was luck; but
      he was not like Jacques Pontiac, he was secretive as a Buddhist deity. He
      had a good many of the characteristics that go to a fashionable
      diplomatist: clever, wicked, cool, and in speech doing the vanishing trick
      just when you wanted him. But my star of fortune was with me. One day
      Silverbottle, an Indian, being in a murderous humour, put a bullet in
      Pretty Pierre&rsquo;s leg, and would have added another, only I stopped it
      suddenly. While in his bed he told me what he knew of the Malbroucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the fashion of it. John and Audrey Malbrouck had come to Quebec
      in the year 1865, and sojourned in the parish of St. Genevieve, in the
      house of the mother of Pretty Pierre. Of an inquiring turn of mind, the
      French half-breed desired to know concerning the history of these English
      people, who, being poor, were yet gentle, and spoke French with a grace
      and accent which was to the French-Canadian patois as Shakespeare&rsquo;s
      English is to that of Seven Dials. Pierre&rsquo;s methods of inquisitiveness
      were not strictly dishonest. He did not open letters, he did not besiege
      dispatch-boxes, he did not ask impudent questions; he watched and
      listened. In his own way he found out that the man had been a soldier in
      the ranks, and that he had served in India. They were most attached to the
      child, whose name was Marguerite. One day a visitor, a lady, came to them.
      She seemed to be the cause of much unhappiness to Mrs. Malbrouck. And
      Pierre was alert enough to discover that this distinguished-looking person
      desired to take the child away with her. To this the young mother would
      not consent, and the visitor departed with some chillingly-polite phrases,
      part English, part French, beyond the exact comprehension of Pierre, and
      leaving the father and mother and little Marguerite happy. Then, however,
      these people seemed to become suddenly poorer, and Malbrouck began farming
      in a humble, but not entirely successful way. The energy of the man was
      prodigious; but his luck was sardonic. Floods destroyed his first crops,
      prices ran low, debt accumulated, foreclosure of mortgage occurred, and
      Malbrouck and the wife and child went west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years later, Pretty Pierre saw them again at Marigold Lake:
      Malbrouck as agent for the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&mdash;still poor, but
      contented. It was at this period that the former visitor again appeared,
      clothed in purple and fine linen, and, strange as it may seem, succeeded
      in carrying off the little child, leaving the father and mother broken,
      but still devoted to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty Pierre closed his narration with these words: &lsquo;&lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; that
      Malbrouck, he is great. I have not much love of men, but he&mdash;well, if
      he say,&mdash;&ldquo;See, Pierre, I go to the home of the white bear and the
      winter that never ends; perhaps we come back, perhaps we die; but there
      will be sport for men&mdash;&rdquo; &lsquo;voila!&rsquo; I would go. To know one strong man
      in this world is good. Perhaps, some time I will go to him&mdash;yes,
      Pierre, the gambler, will go to him, and say: It is good for the wild dog
      that he live near the lion. And the child, she was beautiful; she had a
      light heart and a sweet way.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with this slight knowledge that Gregory Thorne set out on his
      journey over the great Canadian prairie to Marigold Lake, for his December
      moose-hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory has since told me that, as he travelled with Jacques Pontiac
      across the Height of Land to his destination, he had uncomfortable
      feelings; presentiments, peculiar reflections of the past, and melancholy&mdash;a
      thing far from habitual with him. Insolence is all very well, but you
      cannot apply it to indefinite thoughts; it isn&rsquo;t effective with vague
      presentiments. And when Gregory&rsquo;s insolence was taken away from him, he
      was very like other mortals; virtue had gone out of him; his brown cheek
      and frank eye had lost something of their charm. It was these unusual
      broodings that worried him; he waked up suddenly one night calling,
      &ldquo;Margaret! Margaret!&rdquo; like any childlike lover. And that did not please
      him. He believed in things that, as he said himself, &ldquo;he could get between
      his fingers;&rdquo; he had little sympathy with morbid sentimentalities. But
      there was an English Margaret in his life; and he, like many another
      childlike man, had fallen in love, and with her&mdash;very much in love
      indeed; and a star had crossed his love to a degree that greatly shocked
      him and pleased the girl&rsquo;s relatives. She was the granddaughter of a
      certain haughty dame of high degree, who regarded icily this poorest of
      younger sons, and held her darling aloof. Gregory, very like a blunt
      unreasoning lover, sought to carry the redoubt by wild assault; and was
      overwhelmingly routed. The young lady, though finding some avowed pleasure
      in his company, accompanied by brilliant misunderstanding of his advances
      and full-front speeches, had never given him enough encouragement to
      warrant his playing young Lochinvar in Park Lane; and his cup became full
      when, at the close of the season, she was whisked off to the seclusion of
      a country-seat, whose walls to him were impregnable. His defeat was then,
      and afterwards, complete. He pluckily replied to the derision of his
      relatives with multiplied derision, demanded his inheritance, got his
      traps together, bought a fur coat, and straightway sailed the wintry seas
      to Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      His experiences had not soured his temper. He believed that every dog has
      his day, and that Fate was very malicious; that it brought down the proud,
      and rewarded the patient; that it took up its abode in marble halls, and
      was the mocker at the feast. All this had reference, of course, to the
      time when he should&mdash;rich as any nabob&mdash;return to London, and be
      victorious over his enemy in Park Lane. It was singular that he believed
      this thing would occur; but he did. He had not yet made his fortune, but
      he had been successful in the game of buying and selling lands, and luck
      seemed to dog his path. He was fearless, and he had a keen eye for all the
      points of every game&mdash;every game but love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was born to succeed in that game too. For though his theory was,
      that everything should be treated with impertinence before you could get a
      proper view of it, he was markedly respectful to people. Few could resist
      him; his impudence of ideas was so pleasantly mixed with delicately
      suggested admiration of those to whom he talked. It was impossible that
      John Malbrouck and his wife could have received him other than they did;
      his was the eloquent, conquering spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      II.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he reached Lake Marigold he had shaken off all those hovering
      fancies of the woods, which, after all, might only have been the
      whisperings of those friendly and far-seeing spirits who liked the lad as
      he journeyed through their lonely pleasure-grounds. John Malbrouck greeted
      him with quiet cordiality, and Mrs. Malbrouck smiled upon him with a
      different smile from that with which she had speeded him a month before;
      there was in it a new light of knowledge, and Gregory could not understand
      it. It struck him as singular that the lady should be dressed in finer
      garments than she wore when he last saw her; though certainly her purple
      became her. She wore it as if born to it; and with an air more sedately
      courteous than he had ever seen, save at one house in Park Lane. Had this
      rustle of fine trappings been made for him? No; the woman had a mind above
      such snobbishness, he thought. He suffered for a moment the pang of a
      cynical idea; but the eyes of Mrs. Malbrouck were on him and he knew that
      he was as nothing before her. Her eyes&mdash;how they were fixed upon him!
      Only two women had looked so truthfully at him before: his dead mother and&mdash;Margaret.
      And Margaret&mdash;why, how strangely now at this instant came the thought
      that she was like his Margaret! Wonder sprang to his eyes. At that moment
      a door opened and a girl entered the room&mdash;a girl lissome,
      sweet-faced, well-bred of manner, who came slowly towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter, Mr. Thorne,&rdquo; the mother briefly remarked. There was no
      surprise in the girl&rsquo;s face, only an even reserve of pleasure, as she held
      out her hand and said: &ldquo;Mr. Gregory Thorne and I are old enemies.&rdquo; Gregory
      Thorne&rsquo;s nerve forsook him for an instant. He knew now the reason of his
      vague presentiments in the woods; he understood why, one night, when he
      had been more childlike than usual in his memory of the one woman who
      could make life joyous for him, the voice of a voyageur, not Jacques&rsquo;s nor
      that of any one in camp, sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;My dear love, she waits for me,
         None other my world is adorning;
        My true love I come to thee,
         My dear, the white star of the morning.
        Eagles spread out your wings,
         Behold where the red dawn is breaking!
        Hark, &lsquo;tis my darling sings,
         The flowers, the song-birds awaking;
        See, where she comes to me,
         My love, ah, my dear love!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And here she was. He raised her hand to his lips, and said: &ldquo;Miss Carley,
      you have your enemy at an advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Carley in Park Lane, Margaret Malbrouck here in my old home,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ran swiftly through the young man&rsquo;s brain the brief story that
      Pretty Pierre had told him. This, then, was the child who had been carried
      away, and who, years after, had made captive his heart in London town!
      Well, one thing was clear, the girl&rsquo;s mother here seemed inclined to be
      kinder to him than was the guardian grandmother&mdash;if she was the
      grandmother&mdash;because they had their first talk undisturbed, it may be
      encouraged; amiable mothers do such deeds at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now pray, Mr. Thorne,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;may I ask how came you here in
      my father&rsquo;s house after having treated me so cavalierly in London?&mdash;not
      even sending a P.P.C. when you vanished from your worshippers in Vanity
      Fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for my being here, it is simply a case of blind fate; as for my
      friends, the only one I wanted to be sorry for my going was behind
      earthworks which I could not scale in order to leave my card, or&mdash;or
      anything else of more importance; and being left as it were to the
      inclemency of a winter world, I fled from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. &ldquo;What! the conqueror, you, flying from your Moscow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt rather helpless under her gay raillery; but he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t burn my kremlin behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your kremlin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ships, then: they&mdash;they are just the same,&rdquo; he earnestly pleaded.
      Foolish youth, to attempt to take such a heart by surprise and storm!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very interesting,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but hardly wise. To make fortunes
      and be happy in new countries, one should forget the old ones. Meditation
      is the enemy of action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one meditation could make me conquer the North Pole, if I could
      but grasp it definitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grasp the North Pole? That would be awkward for your friends and
      gratifying to your enemies, if one may believe science and history. But,
      perhaps, you are in earnest after all, poor fellow! for my father tells me
      you are going over the hills and far away to the moose-yards. How valiant
      you are, and how quickly you grasp the essentials of fortune-making!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Malbrouck, I am in earnest, and I&rsquo;ve always been in earnest in one
      thing at least. I came out here to make money, and I&rsquo;ve made some, and
      shall make more; but just now the moose are as brands for the burning, and
      I have a gun sulky for want of exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an eloquent warrior-temper! And to whom are your deeds of valour to
      be dedicated? Before whom do you intend to lay your trophies of the
      chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the most provoking but worshipful lady that I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the sylvan maid? What princess of the glade has now the homage of
      your impressionable heart, Mr. Thorne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gregory Thorne, his native insolence standing him in no stead, said
      very humbly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are that sylvan maid, that princess&mdash;ah, is this fair to me, is
      it fair, I ask you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really mean that about the trophies&rdquo;? she replied. &ldquo;And shall you
      return like the mighty khans, with captive tigers and lions, led by
      stalwart slaves, in your train, or shall they be captive moose or
      grizzlies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grizzlies are not possible here,&rdquo; he said, with cheerful seriousness,
      &ldquo;but the moose is possible, and more, if you would be kinder&mdash;Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your supper, see, is ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I venture to hope your appetite
      has not suffered because of long absence from your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could only dumbly answer by a protesting motion of the hand, and his
      smile was not remarkably buoyant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they started on their moose-hunt. Gregory Thorne was cast
      down when he crossed the threshold into the winter morning without
      hand-clasp or god-speed from Margaret Malbrouck; but Mrs. Malbrouck was
      there, and Gregory, looking into her eyes, thought how good a thing it
      would be for him, if some such face looked benignly out on him every
      morning, before he ventured forth into the deceitful day. But what was the
      use of wishing! Margaret evidently did not care. And though the air was
      clear and the sun shone brightly, he felt there was a cheerless wind
      blowing on him; a wind that chilled him; and he hummed to himself bitterly
      a song of the voyageurs:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;O, O, the winter wind, the North wind,
         My snow-bird, where art thou gone?
        O, O, the wailing wind the night wind,
         The cold nest; I am alone.
        O, O, my snow-bird!

       &ldquo;O, O, the waving sky, the white sky,
         My snow-bird thou fliest far;
        O, O, the eagle&rsquo;s cry, the wild cry,
         My lost love, my lonely star.
        O, O, my snow-bird!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He was about to start briskly forward to join Malbrouck and his Indians,
      who were already on their way, when he heard his name called, and,
      turning, he saw Margaret in the doorway, her fingers held to the tips of
      her ears, as yet unused to the frost. He ran back to where she stood, and
      held out his hand. &ldquo;I was afraid,&rdquo; he bluntly said, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t
      forsake your morning sleep to say good-bye to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t always the custom, is it,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for ladies to send the
      very early hunter away with a tally-ho? But since you have the grace to be
      afraid of anything, I can excuse myself to myself for fleeing the
      pleasantest dreams to speed you on your warlike path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this he brightened very much, but she, as if repenting she had given
      him so much pleasure, added: &ldquo;I wanted to say good-bye to my father, you
      know; and&mdash;&rdquo; she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&rdquo;? he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to tell him that you have fond relatives in the old land who would
      mourn your early taking off; and, therefore, to beg him, for their sakes,
      to keep you safe from any outrageous moose that mightn&rsquo;t know how the
      world needed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there you are mistaken,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anyone who would really
      care, worse luck! except the dowager; and she, perhaps, would be consoled
      to know that I had died in battle,&mdash;even with a moose,&mdash;and was
      clear of the possibility of hanging another lost reputation on the family
      tree, to say nothing of suspension from any other kind of tree. But, if it
      should be the other way; if I should see your father in the path of an
      outrageous moose&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is a hunter born,&rdquo; she responded; &ldquo;he is a great man,&rdquo; she
      proudly added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Good-bye. I&rsquo;ll take him your love.&mdash;Good-bye!&rdquo;
       and he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she gaily replied; and yet, one looking closely would have
      seen that this stalwart fellow was pleasant to her eyes, and as she closed
      the door to his hand waving farewell to her from the pines, she said,
      reflecting on his words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take him my love, will you? But, Master Gregory, you carry a
      freight of which you do not know the measure; and, perhaps, you never
      shall, though you are very brave and honest, and not so impudent as you
      used to be,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not so sure that I like you so much better for
      that either, Monsieur Gregory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she went and laid her cheek against her mother&rsquo;s, and said: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      gone away for big game, mother dear; what shall be our quarry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; the mother replied, &ldquo;the story of our lives since last you
      were with me is my only quarry. I want to know from your own lips all that
      you have been in that life which once was mine also, but far away from me
      now, even though you come from it, bringing its memories without its
      messages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, do you think that life there was so sweet to me? It meant as little
      to your daughter as to you. She was always a child of the wild woods. What
      rustle of pretty gowns is pleasant as the silken shiver of the maple
      leaves in summer at this door? The happiest time in that life was when we
      got away to Holwood or Marchurst, with the balls and calls all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Malbrouck smoothed her daughter&rsquo;s hand gently and smiled approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that old life of yours, mother; what was it? You said that you would
      tell me some day. Tell me now. Grandmother was fond of me&mdash;poor
      grandmother! But she would never tell me anything. How I longed to be back
      with you!... Sometimes you came to me in my sleep, and called to me to
      come with you; and then again, when I was gay in the sunshine, you came,
      and only smiled but never beckoned; though your eyes seemed to me very
      sad, and I wondered if mine would not also become sad through looking in
      them so&mdash;are they sad, mother?&rdquo; And she laughed up brightly into her
      mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; they are like the stars. You ask me for my part in that life. I
      will tell you soon, but not now. Be patient. Do you not tire of this
      lonely life? Are you truly not anxious to return to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To the husks that the swine did eat?&rsquo; No, no, no; for, see: I was born
      for a free, strong life; the prairie or the wild wood, or else to live in
      some far castle in Welsh mountains, where I should never hear the voice of
      the social Thou must!&mdash;oh, what a must! never to be quite free or
      natural. To be the slave of the code. I was born&mdash;I know not how! but
      so longing for the sky, and space, and endless woods. I think I never saw
      an animal but I loved it, nor ever lounged the mornings out at Holwood but
      I wished it were a hut on the mountain side, and you and father with me.&rdquo;
       Here she whispered, in a kind of awe: &ldquo;And yet to think that Holwood is
      now mine, and that I am mistress there, and that I must go back to it&mdash;if
      only you would go back with me.... ah, dear, isn&rsquo;t it your duty to go back
      with me&rdquo;? she added, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey Malbrouck drew her daughter hungrily to her bosom, and said: &ldquo;Yes,
      dear, I will go back, if it chances that you need me; but your father and
      I have lived the best days of our lives here, and we are content. But, my
      Margaret, there is another to be thought of too, is there not? And in that
      case is my duty then so clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s hand closed on her mother&rsquo;s, and she knew her heart had been
      truly read.
    </p>
    <p>
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters pursued their way, swinging grandly along on their snow-shoes,
      as they made for the Wild Hawk Woods. It would seem as if Malbrouck was
      testing Gregory&rsquo;s strength and stride, for the march that day was a long
      and hard one. He was equal to the test, and even Big Moccasin, the chief,
      grunted sound approval. But every day brought out new capacities for
      endurance and larger resources; so that Malbrouck, who had known the clash
      of civilisation with barbarian battle, and deeds both dour and doughty,
      and who loved a man of might, regarded this youth with increasing favour.
      By simple processes he drew from Gregory his aims and ambitions, and found
      the real courage and power behind the front of irony&mdash;the language of
      manhood and culture which was crusted by free and easy idioms. Now and
      then they saw moose-tracks, but they were some days out before they came
      to a moose-yard&mdash;a spot hoof-beaten by the moose; his home, from
      which he strays, and to which he returns at times like a repentant
      prodigal. Now the sport began. The dog-trains were put out of view, and
      Big Moccasin and another Indian went off immediately to explore the
      country round about. A few hours, and word was brought that there was a
      small herd feeding not far away. Together they crept stealthily within
      range of the cattle. Gregory Thorne&rsquo;s blood leaped as he saw the noble
      quarry, with their wide-spread horns, sniffing the air, in which they had
      detected something unusual. Their leader, a colossal beast, stamped with
      his forefoot, and threw back his head with a snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first shot belongs to you, Mr. Thorne,&rdquo; said Malbrouck. &ldquo;In the
      shoulder, you know. You have him in good line. I&rsquo;ll take the heifer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory showed all the coolness of an old hunter, though his lips twitched
      slightly with excitement. He took a short but steady aim, and fired. The
      beast plunged forward and then fell on his knees. The others broke away.
      Malbrouck fired and killed a heifer, and then all ran in pursuit as the
      moose made for the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory, in the pride of his first slaughter, sprang away towards the
      wounded leader, which, sunk to the earth, was shaking its great horns to
      and fro. When at close range, he raised his gun to fire again, but the
      moose rose suddenly, and with a wild bellowing sound rushed at Gregory,
      who knew full well that a straight stroke from those hoofs would end his
      moose-hunting days. He fired, but to no effect. He could not, like a
      toreador, jump aside, for those mighty horns would sweep too wide a space.
      He dropped on his knees swiftly, and as the great antlers almost touched
      him, and he could feel the roaring breath of the mad creature in his face,
      he slipped a cartridge in, and fired as he swung round; but at that
      instant a dark body bore him down. He was aware of grasping those sweeping
      horns, conscious of a blow which tore the flesh from his chest; and then
      his knife&mdash;how came it in his hand?&mdash;with the instinct of the
      true hunter. He plunged it once, twice, past a foaming mouth, into that
      firm body, and then both fell together; each having fought valiantly after
      his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory dragged himself from beneath the still heaving body, and stretched
      to his feet; but a blindness came, and the next knowledge he had was of
      brandy being poured slowly between his teeth, and of a voice coming
      through endless distances: &ldquo;A fighter, a born fighter,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;The
      pluck of Lucifer&mdash;good boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the voice left those humming spaces of infinity, and said: &ldquo;Tilt him
      this way a little, Big Moccasin. There, press firmly, so. Now the band
      steady&mdash;together&mdash;tighter&mdash;now the withes&mdash;a little
      higher up&mdash;cut them here.&rdquo; There was a slight pause, and then:
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s as good as an army surgeon could do it. He&rsquo;ll be as sound
      as a bell in two weeks. Eh, well, how do you feel now? Better? That&rsquo;s
      right! Like to be on your feet, would you? Wait. Here, a sup of this.
      There you are.... Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young man, faintly, &ldquo;he was a beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malbrouck looked at him a moment, thoughtfully, and then said: &ldquo;Yes, he
      was a beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a dozen more like him, and then I shall be able to drop &lsquo;em as
      neat as, you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! the order is large. I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have to fill it at some
      other time;&rdquo; and Malbrouck smiled a little grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! only one moose to take back to the Height of Land, to&mdash;&rdquo;
       something in the eye of the other stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To? Yes, to&rdquo;? and now the eye had a suggestion of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To show I&rsquo;m not a tenderfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to show you&rsquo;re not a tenderfoot. I fancy that will be hardly
      necessary. Oh, you will be up, eh? Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a tottering imbecile. What&rsquo;s the matter with my legs?&mdash;my
      prophetic soul, it hurts! Oh, I see; that&rsquo;s where the old warrior&rsquo;s hoof
      caught me sideways. Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I&rsquo;m going to have another
      moose to take back to Marigold Lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going to take back a young, live moose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A significant ambition. For what?&mdash;a sacrifice to the gods you have
      offended in your classic existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both. A peace-offering, and a sacrifice to&mdash;a goddess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the other, the light of a smile playing on his lips,
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Prosperity be thy page!&rsquo; Big Moccasin, what of this young live moose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian shook his head doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you I shall have that live moose, if I have to stay here to
      see it grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Malbrouck liked his pluck, and wished him good luck. And the good luck
      came. They travelled back slowly to the Height of Land, making a circuit.
      For a week they saw no more moose; but meanwhile Gregory&rsquo;s hurt quickly
      healed. They had now left only eight days in which to get back to Dog Ear
      River and Marigold Lake. If the young moose was to come it must come soon.
      It came soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They chanced upon a moose-yard, and while the Indians were beating the
      woods, Malbrouck and Gregory watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a cow and a young moose came swinging down to the embankment.
      Malbrouck whispered: &ldquo;Now if you must have your live moose, here&rsquo;s a
      lasso. I&rsquo;ll bring down the cow. The young one&rsquo;s horns are not large.
      Remember, no pulling. I&rsquo;ll do that. Keep your broken chest and bad arm
      safe. Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down came the cow with a plunge into the yard-dead. The lasso, too, was
      over the horns of the calf, and in an instant Malbrouck was swinging away
      with it over the snow. It was making for the trees&mdash;exactly what
      Malbrouck desired. He deftly threw the rope round a sapling, but not too
      taut, lest the moose&rsquo;s horns should be injured. The plucky animal now
      turned on him. He sprang behind a tree, and at that instant he heard the
      thud of hoofs behind him. He turned to see a huge bull-moose bounding
      towards him. He was between two fires, and quite unarmed. Those hoofs had
      murder in them. But at the instant a rifle shot rang out, and he only
      caught the forward rush of the antlers as the beast fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young moose now had ceased its struggles, and came forward to the dead
      bull with that hollow sound of mourning peculiar to its kind. Though it
      afterwards struggled once or twice to be free, it became docile and was
      easily taught, when its anger and fear were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gregory Thorne had his live moose. He had also, by that splendid shot,
      achieved with one arm, saved Malbrouck from peril, perhaps from death.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew up before the house at Marigold Lake on the afternoon of the day
      before Christmas, a triumphal procession. The moose was driven, a peaceful
      captive with a wreath of cedar leaves around its neck&mdash;the humourous
      conception of Gregory Thorne. Malbrouck had announced their coming by a
      blast from his horn, and Margaret was standing in the doorway wrapped in
      furs, which may have come originally from Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, but which had been
      deftly re-manufactured in Regent Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonishment, pleasure, beamed in her eyes. She clapped her hands gaily,
      and cried: &ldquo;Welcome, welcome, merry-men all!&rdquo; She kissed her father; she
      called to her mother to come and see; then she said to Gregory, with arch
      raillery, as she held out her hand: &ldquo;Oh, companion of hunters, comest thou
      like Jacques in Arden from dropping the trustful tear upon the prey of
      others, or bringest thou quarry of thine own? Art thou a warrior sated
      with spoil, master of the sports, spectator of the fight, Prince, or
      Pistol? Answer, what art thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he, with a touch of his old insolence, though with something of irony
      too, for he had hoped for a different fashion of greeting, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All, lady, all! The Olympian all! The player of many parts. I am
      Touchstone, Jacques, and yet Orlando too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet Orlando too, my daughter,&rdquo; said Malbrouck, gravely. &ldquo;He saved
      your father from the hoofs of a moose bent on sacrifice. Had your father
      his eye, his nerve, his power to shoot with one arm a bull moose at long
      range, so!&mdash;he would not refuse to be called a great hunter, but wear
      the title gladly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Malbrouck&rsquo;s face became anxious instantly. &ldquo;He saved you from
      danger&mdash;from injury, father&rdquo;? she slowly said, and looked earnestly
      at Gregory; &ldquo;but why to shoot with one arm only?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because in a fight of his own with a moose&mdash;a hand-to-hand fight&mdash;he
      had a bad moment with the hoofs of the beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this young man, who had a reputation for insolence, blushed, so that
      the paleness which the girl now noticed in his face was banished; and to
      turn the subject he interposed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the live moose that I said I should bring. Now say that he&rsquo;s a
      beauty, please. Your father and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Malbrouck interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lassoed it with his one arm, Margaret. He was determined to do it
      himself, because, being a superstitious gentleman, as well as a hunter, he
      had some foolish notion that this capture would propitiate a goddess whom
      he imagined required offerings of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the privilege of the gods to be merciful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This
      peace-offering should propitiate the angriest, cruellest goddess in the
      universe; and for one who was neither angry nor really cruel&mdash;well,
      she should be satisfied.... altogether satisfied,&rdquo; she added, as she put
      her cheek against the warm fur of the captive&rsquo;s neck, and let it feel her
      hand with its lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a minute, and then with his old gay spirit all
      returned, and as if to give an air not too serious to the situation,
      Gregory, remembering his Euripides, said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;........let the steer bleed,
     And the rich altars, as they pay their vows,
     Breathe incense to the gods: for me, I rise
     To better life, and grateful own the blessing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pagan thought for a Christmas Eve,&rdquo; she said to him, with her fingers
      feeling for the folds of silken flesh in the throat of the moose; &ldquo;but
      wounded men must be humoured. And, mother dear, here are our Argonauts
      returned; and&mdash;and now I think I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a quick kiss on her father&rsquo;s cheek&mdash;not so quick but he caught
      the tear that ran through her happy smile&mdash;she vanished into the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night there was gladness in this home. Mirth sprang to the lips of
      the men like foam on a beaker of wine, so that the evening ran towards
      midnight swiftly. All the tale of the hunt was given by Malbrouck to
      joyful ears; for the mother lived again her youth in the sunrise of this
      romance which was being sped before her eyes; and the father, knowing that
      in this world there is nothing so good as courage, nothing so base as the
      shifting eye, looked on the young man, and was satisfied, and told his
      story well;&mdash;told it as a brave man would tell it, bluntly as to
      deeds done, warmly as to the pleasures of good sport, directly as to all.
      In the eye of the young man there had come the glance of larger life, of a
      new-developed manhood. When he felt that dun body crashing on him, and his
      life closing with its strength, and ran the good knife home, there flashed
      through his mind how much life meant to the dying, how much it ought to
      mean to the living; and then this girl, this Margaret, swam before his
      eyes&mdash;and he had been graver since.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, as truly as if she had told him, that she could never mate with
      any man who was a loiterer on God&rsquo;s highway, who could live life without
      some sincerity in his aims. It all came to him again in this room, so
      austere in its appointments, yet so gracious, so full of the spirit of
      humanity without a note of ennui, or the rust of careless deeds. As this
      thought grew he looked at the face of the girl, then at the faces of the
      father and mother, and the memory of his boast came back&mdash;that he
      would win the stake he laid, to know the story of John and Audrey
      Malbrouck before this coming Christmas morning. With a faint smile at his
      own past insolent self, he glanced at the clock. It was eleven. &ldquo;I have
      lost my bet,&rdquo; he unconsciously said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused by John Malbrouck remarking: &ldquo;Yes, you have lost your bet?
      Well, what was it? The youth, the childlike quality in him,&rdquo; flushed his
      face deeply, and then, with a sudden burst of frankness, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that I had spoken. As for the bet, I deserve to be
      thrashed for ever having made it; but, duffer as I am, I want you to know
      that I&rsquo;m something worse than duffer. The first time I met you I made a
      bet that I should know your history before Christmas Day. I haven&rsquo;t a word
      to say for myself. I&rsquo;m contemptible. I beg your pardon; for your history
      is none of my business. I was really interested; that&rsquo;s all; but your
      lives, I believe it, as if it was in the Bible, have been great&mdash;yes,
      that&rsquo;s the word! and I&rsquo;m a better chap for having known you, though,
      perhaps, I&rsquo;ve known you all along, because, you see, I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
      friends with your daughter&mdash;and-well, really I haven&rsquo;t anything else
      to say, except that I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me, and let me know you always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malbrouck regarded him for a moment with a grave smile, and then looked
      toward his wife. Both turned their glances quickly upon Margaret, whose
      eyes were on the fire. The look upon her face was very gentle; something
      new and beautiful had come to reign there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment, and Malbrouck spoke: &ldquo;You did what was youthful and curious, but
      not wrong; and you shall not lose your hazard. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do not tell me,&rdquo; Gregory interrupted; &ldquo;only let me be pardoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I said, lad, you shall not lose your hazard. I will tell you the brief
      tale of two lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I beg of you! For the instant I forgot. I have more to confess.&rdquo; And
      Gregory told them in substance what Pretty Pierre had disclosed to him in
      the Rocky Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished, Malbrouck said: &ldquo;My tale then is briefer still: I
      was a common soldier, English and humble by my mother, French and noble
      through my father&mdash;noble, but poor. In Burmah, at an outbreak among
      the natives, I rescued my colonel from immediate and horrible death,
      though he died in my arms from the injuries he received. His daughter too,
      it was my fortune, through God&rsquo;s Providence, to save from great danger.
      She became my wife. You remember that song you sang the day we first met
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It brought her father back to mind painfully. When we came to England her
      people&mdash;her mother&mdash;would not receive me. For myself I did not
      care; for my wife, that was another matter. She loved me and preferred to
      go with me anywhere; to a new country, preferably. We came to Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were forgotten in England. Time moves so fast, even if the records in
      red-books stand. Our daughter went to her grandmother to be brought up and
      educated in England&mdash;though it was a sore trial to us both&mdash;that
      she might fill nobly that place in life for which she is destined. With
      all she learned she did not forget us. We were happy save in her absence.
      We are happy now; not because she is mistress of Holwood and Marchurst&mdash;for
      her grandmother and another is dead&mdash;but because such as she is our
      daughter, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more. Margaret was beside him, and her fingers were on his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory came to his feet suddenly, and with a troubled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress of Holwood and Marchurst!&rdquo; he said; and his mind ran over his
      own great deficiencies, and the list of eligible and anxious suitors that
      Park Lane could muster. He had never thought of her in the light of a
      great heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he looked down at her as she knelt at her father&rsquo;s knee, her eyes
      upturned to his, and the tide of his fear retreated; for he saw in them
      the same look she had given him when she leaned her cheek against the
      moose&rsquo;s neck that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the clock struck twelve upon a moment&rsquo;s pleasant silence, John
      Malbrouck said to Gregory Thorne:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have won your Christmas hazard, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a softer voice than his whispered: &ldquo;Are you&mdash;content&mdash;Gregory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spirits of Christmas-tide, whose paths lie north as well as south,
      smiled as they wrote his answer on their tablets; for they knew, as the
      man said, that he would always be content, and&mdash;which is more in the
      sight of angels&mdash;that the woman would be content also.

    <h2>
      A PRAIRIE VAGABOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little Hammer was not a success. He was a disappointment to the
      missionaries; the officials of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company said he was &ldquo;no
      good;&rdquo; the Mounted Police kept an eye on him; the Crees and Blackfeet
      would have nothing to do with him; and the half-breeds were profane
      regarding him. But Little Hammer was oblivious to any depreciation of his
      merits, and would not be suppressed. He loved the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s
      Post at Yellow Quill with an unwavering love; he ranged the half-breed
      hospitality of Red Deer River, regardless of it being thrown at him as he
      in turn threw it at his dog; he saluted Sergeant Gellatly with a familiar
      How! whenever he saw him; he borrowed tabac of the half-breed women, and,
      strange to say, paid it back&mdash;with other tabac got by daily petition,
      until his prayer was granted, at the H. B. C. Post. He knew neither shame
      nor defeat, but where women were concerned he kept his word, and was
      singularly humble. It was a woman that induced him to be baptised. The day
      after the ceremony he begged &ldquo;the loan of a dollar for the love of God&rdquo;
       from the missionary; and being refused, straightway, and for the only time
      it was known of him, delivered a rumbling torrent of half-breed profanity,
      mixed with the unusual oaths of the barracks. Then he walked away with
      great humility. There was no swagger about Little Hammer. He was simply
      unquenchable and continuous. He sometimes got drunk; but on such occasions
      he sat down, or lay down, in the most convenient place, and, like Caesar
      beside Pompey&rsquo;s statue, wrapped his mantle about his face and forgot the
      world. He was a vagabond Indian, abandoned yet self-contained, outcast yet
      gregarious. No social ostracism unnerved him, no threats of the H. B. C.
      officials moved him; and when in the winter of 187 he was driven from one
      place to another, starving and homeless, and came at last emaciated and
      nearly dead to the Post at Yellow Quill, he asked for food and shelter as
      if it were his right, and not as a mendicant.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, shortly after his reception and restoration, he was sitting in
      the store silently smoking the Company&rsquo;s tabac. Sergeant Gellatly entered.
      Little Hammer rose, offered his hand, and muttered, &ldquo;How!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant thrust his hand aside, and said sharply: &ldquo;Whin I take y&rsquo;r
      hand, Little Hammer, it&rsquo;ll be to put a grip an y&rsquo;r wrists that&rsquo;ll stay
      there till y&rsquo;are in quarters out of which y&rsquo;ll come nayther winter nor
      summer. Put that in y&rsquo;r pipe and smoke it, y&rsquo; scamp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Hammer had a bad time at the Post that night. Lounging half-breeds
      reviled him; the H. B. C. officials rebuked him; and travellers who were
      coming and going shared in the derision, as foolish people do where one is
      brow-beaten by many. At last a trapper entered, whom seeing, Little Hammer
      drew his blanket up about his head. The trapper sat down very near Little
      Hammer, and began to smoke. He laid his plug-tabac and his knife on the
      counter beside him. Little Hammer reached over and took the knife, putting
      it swiftly within his blanket. The trapper saw the act, and, turning
      sharply on the Indian, called him a thief. Little Hammer chuckled
      strangely and said nothing; but his eyes peered sharply above the blanket.
      A laugh went round the store. In an instant the trapper, with a loud oath,
      caught at the Indian&rsquo;s throat; but as the blanket dropped back he gave a
      startled cry. There was the flash of a knife, and he fell back dead.
      Little Hammer stood above him, smiling, for a moment, and then, turning to
      Sergeant Gellatly, held out his arms silently for the handcuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day two men were lost on the prairies. One was Sergeant Gellatly;
      the other was Little Hammer. The horses they rode travelled so close that
      the leg of the Indian crowded the leg of the white man; and the wilder the
      storm grew, the closer still they rode. A &lsquo;poudre&rsquo; day, with its steely
      air and fatal frost, was an ill thing in the world; but these entangling
      blasts, these wild curtains of snow, were desolating even unto death. The
      sun above was smothered; the earth beneath was trackless; the compass
      stood for loss all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Sergeant Gellatly expect, riding with a murderer on his left
      hand: a heathen that had sent a knife through the heart of one of the
      lords of the North? What should the gods do but frown, or the elements be
      at, but howling on their path? What should one hope for but that vengeance
      should be taken out of the hands of mortals, and be delivered to the angry
      spirits?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the gods were angry at the Indian, why should Sergeant Gellatly
      only sway to and fro, and now laugh recklessly, and now fall sleepily
      forward on the neck of his horse; while the Indian rode straight, and
      neither wavered nor wandered in mind, but at last slipped from his horse
      and walked beside the other? It was at this moment that the soldier heard,
      &ldquo;Sergeant Gellatly, Sergeant Gellatly,&rdquo; called through the blast; and he
      thought it came from the skies, or from some other world. &ldquo;Me darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;have y&rsquo; come to me?&rdquo; But the voice called again: &ldquo;Sergeant
      Gellatly, keep awake! keep awake! You sleep, you die; that&rsquo;s it. Holy.
      Yes. How!&rdquo; Then he knew that it was Little Hammer calling in his ear, and
      shaking him; that the Indian was dragging him from his horse ... his
      revolver, where was it? he had forgotten... he nodded... nodded. But
      Little Hammer said: &ldquo;Walk, hell! you walk, yes;&rdquo; and Little Hammer struck
      him again and again; but one arm of the Indian was under his shoulder and
      around him, and the voice was anxious and kind. Slowly it came to him that
      Little Hammer was keeping him alive against the will of the spirits&mdash;but
      why should they strike him instead of the Indian? Was there any sun in the
      world? Had there ever been? or fire or heat anywhere, or anything but wind
      and snow in all God&rsquo;s universe?... Yes, there were bells ringing&mdash;soft
      bells of a village church; and there was incense burning&mdash;most sweet
      it was! and the coals in the censer&mdash;how beautiful, how comforting!
      He laughed with joy again, and he forgot how cold, how maliciously cold,
      he had been; he forgot how dreadful that hour was before he became warm;
      when he was pierced by myriad needles through the body, and there was an
      incredible aching at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet something kept thundering on his body, and a harsh voice shrieked
      at him, and there were many lights dancing over his shut eyes; and then
      curtains of darkness were dropped, and centuries of oblivion came; and
      then&mdash;then his eyes opened to a comforting silence, and some one was
      putting brandy between his teeth, and after a time he heard a voice say:
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; you see he was a murderer, but he save his captor. &lsquo;Voila,&rsquo; such
      a heathen! But you will, all the same, bring him to justice&mdash;you call
      it that? But we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then some one replied, and the words passed through an outer web of
      darkness and an inner haze of dreams. &ldquo;The feet of Little Hammer were like
      wood on the floor when you brought the two in, Pretty Pierre&mdash;and
      lucky for them you found them.... The thing would read right in a book,
      but it&rsquo;s not according to the run of things up here, not by a damned
      sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private Bradshaw,&rdquo; said the first voice again, &ldquo;you do not know Little
      Hammer, nor that story of him. You wait for the trial. I have something to
      say. You think Little Hammer care for the prison, the rope?&mdash;Ah, when
      a man wait five years to kill&mdash;so! and it is done, he is glad
      sometimes when it is all over. Sergeant Gellatly there will wish he went
      to sleep forever in the snow, if Little Hammer come to the rope. Yes, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Sergeant Gellatly&rsquo;s brain was so numbed that he did not grasp the
      meaning of the words, though he said them over and over again.... Was he
      dead? No, for his body was beating, beating... well, it didn&rsquo;t matter...
      nothing mattered... he was sinking to forgetfulness... sinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for hours, for weeks&mdash;it might have been for years&mdash;and then
      he woke, clear and knowing, to &ldquo;the unnatural, intolerable day&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was that to him, with Little Hammer in prison. It was March when his
      memory and vigour vanished; it was May when he grasped the full
      remembrance of himself, and of that fight for life on the prairie: of the
      hands that smote him that he should not sleep; of Little Hammer the
      slayer, who had driven death back discomfited, and brought his captor safe
      to where his own captivity and punishment awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sergeant Gellatly appeared in court at the trial he refused to bear
      witness against Little Hammer. &ldquo;D&rsquo; ye think&mdash;does wan av y&rsquo; think&mdash;that
      I&rsquo;ll speak a word agin the man&mdash;haythen or no haythen&mdash;that
      pulled me out of me tomb and put me betune the barrack quilts? Here&rsquo;s the
      stripes aff me arm, and to gaol I&rsquo;ll go; but for what wint before I clapt
      the iron on his wrists, good or avil, divil a word will I say. An&rsquo; here&rsquo;s
      me left hand, and there&rsquo;s me right fut, and an eye of me too, that I&rsquo;d
      part with, for the cause of him that&rsquo;s done a trick that your honour
      wouldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;an&rsquo; no shame to y&rsquo; aither&mdash;an&rsquo; y&rsquo;d been where
      Little Hammer was with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His honour did not reply immediately, but he looked meditatively at Little
      Hammer before he said quietly,&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps not, perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Little Hammer, thinking he was expected to speak, drew his blanket up
      closely about him and grunted, &ldquo;How!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre, the notorious half-breed, was then called. He kissed the
      Book, making the sign of the Cross swiftly as he did so, and unheeding the
      ironical, if hesitating, laughter in the court. Then he said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; I
      will tell you the story-the whole truth. I was in the Stony Plains. Little
      Hammer was &lsquo;good Injin&rsquo; then.... Yes, sacre! it is a fool who smiles at
      that. I have kissed the Book. Dam!... He would be chief soon when old Two
      Tails die. He was proud, then, Little Hammer. He go not to the Post for
      drink; he sell not next year&rsquo;s furs for this year&rsquo;s rations; he shoot
      straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Little Hammer stood up and said: &ldquo;There is too much talk. Let me be.
      It is all done. The sun is set&mdash;I care not&mdash;I have killed him;&rdquo;
       and then he drew his blanket about his face and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pierre continued: &ldquo;Yes, you killed him-quick, after five years&mdash;that
      is so; but you will not speak to say why. Then, I will speak. The Injins
      say Little Hammer will be great man; he will bring the tribes together;
      and all the time Little Hammer was strong and silent and wise. Then
      Brigley the trapper&mdash;well, he was a thief and coward. He come to
      Little Hammer and say, &lsquo;I am hungry and tired.&rsquo; Little Hammer give him
      food and sleep. He go away. &lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; he come back and say,&mdash;&lsquo;It is far
      to go; I have no horse.&rsquo; So Little Hammer give him a horse too. Then he
      come back once again in the night when Little Hammer was away, and before
      morning he go; but when Little Hammer return, there lay his bride&mdash;only
      an Injin girl, but his bride-dead! You see? Eh? No? Well, the Captain at
      the Post he says it was the same as Lucrece.&mdash;I say it was like hell.
      It is not much to kill or to die&mdash;that is in the game; but that
      other, &lsquo;mon Dieu!&rsquo; Little Hammer, you see how he hide his head: not
      because he kill the Tarquin, that Brigley, but because he is a poor
      &lsquo;vaurien&rsquo; now, and he once was happy and had a wife.... What would you do,
      judge honourable? ... Little Hammer, I shake your hand&mdash;so&mdash;How!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Little Hammer made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge sentenced Little Hammer to one month in gaol. He might have made
      it one thousand months&mdash;it would have been the same; for when, on the
      last morning of that month, they opened the door to set him free, he was
      gone. That is, the Little Hammer whom the high gods knew was gone; though
      an ill-nourished, self-strangled body was upright by the wall. The
      vagabond had paid his penalty, but desired no more of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the door was scratched the one word: How!

    <h2>
      SHE OF THE TRIPLE CHEVRON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between Archangel&rsquo;s Rise and Pardon&rsquo;s Drive there was but one house. It
      was a tavern, and it was known as Galbraith&rsquo;s Place. There was no man in
      the Western Territories to whom it was not familiar. There was no
      traveller who crossed the lonely waste but was glad of it, and would go
      twenty miles out of his way to rest a night on a corn-husk bed which Jen
      Galbraith&rsquo;s hands had filled, to eat a meal that she had prepared, and to
      hear Peter Galbraith&rsquo;s tales of early days on the plains, when buffalo
      were like clouds on the horizon, when Indians were many and hostile, and
      when men called the great western prairie a wedge of the American desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night on the prairie. Jen Galbraith stood in the doorway of the
      tavern sitting-room and watched a mighty beacon of flame rising before
      her, a hundred yards away. Every night this beacon made a circle of light
      on the prairie, and Galbraith&rsquo;s Place was in the centre of the circle.
      Summer and winter it burned from dusk to daylight. No hand fed it but that
      of Nature. It never failed; it was a cruse that was never empty. Upon Jen
      Galbraith it had a weird influence. It grew to be to her a kind of
      spiritual companion, though, perhaps, she would not so have named it. This
      flaming gas, bubbling up from the depths of the earth on the lonely
      plains, was to her a mysterious presence grateful to her; the receiver of
      her thoughts, the daily necessity in her life. It filled her too with a
      kind of awe; for, when it burned, she seemed not herself alone, but
      another self of her whom she could not quite understand. Yet she was no
      mere dreamer. Upon her practical strength of body and mind had come that
      rugged poetical sense, which touches all who live the life of mountain and
      prairie. She showed it in her speech; it had a measured cadence. She
      expressed it in her body; it had a free and rhythmic movement. And not Jen
      alone, but many another dweller on the prairie, looked upon it with a
      superstitious reverence akin to worship. A blizzard could not quench it. A
      gale of wind only fed its strength. A rain-storm made a mist about it, in
      which it was enshrined like a god. Peter Galbraith could not fully
      understand his daughter&rsquo;s fascination for this Prairie Star, as the
      North-West people called it. It was not without its natural influence upon
      him; but he regarded it most as a comfortable advertisement, and he
      lamented every day that this never-failing gas well was not near a large
      population, and he still its owner. He was one of that large family in the
      earth who would turn the best things in their lives into merchandise. As
      it was, it brought much grist to his mill; for he was not averse to the
      exercise of the insinuating pleasures of euchre and poker in his tavern;
      and the hospitality which ranchmen, cowboys, and travellers sought at his
      hand was often prolonged, and also remunerative to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre, who had his patrol as gamester defined, made semi-annual
      visits to Galbraith&rsquo;s Place. It occurred generally after the rounding-up
      and branding seasons, when the cowboys and ranchmen were &ldquo;flush&rdquo; with
      money. It was generally conceded that Monsieur Pierre would have made an
      early excursion to a place where none is ever &ldquo;ordered up,&rdquo; if he had not
      been free with the money which he so plentifully won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Card-playing was to him a science and a passion. He loved to win for
      winning&rsquo;s sake. After that, money, as he himself put it, was only fit to
      be spent for the good of the country, and that men should earn more. Since
      he put his philosophy into instant and generous practice, active and
      deadly prejudice against him did not have lengthened life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mounted Police, or as they are more poetically called, the Riders of
      the Plains, watched Galbraith&rsquo;s Place, not from any apprehension of
      violent events, but because Galbraith was suspected of infringing the
      prevailing law of Prohibition, and because for some years it had been a
      tradition and a custom to keep an eye on Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jen Galbraith stood in the doorway looking abstractedly at the beacon,
      her fingers smoothing her snowy apron the while, she was thinking thus to
      herself: &ldquo;Perhaps father is right. If that Prairie Star were only at
      Vancouver or Winnipeg instead of here, our Val could be something, more
      than a prairie-rider. He&rsquo;d have been different, if father hadn&rsquo;t started
      this tavern business. Not that our Val is bad. He isn&rsquo;t; but if he had
      money he could buy a ranch,&mdash;or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our Val, as Jen and her father called him, was a lad of twenty-two, one
      year younger than Jen. He was prairie-rider, cattle-dealer, scout, cowboy,
      happy-go-lucky vagrant,&mdash;a splendid Bohemian of the plains. As Jen
      said, he was not bad; but he had a fiery, wandering spirit, touched withal
      by the sunniest humour. He had never known any curb but Jen&rsquo;s love and
      care. That had kept him within bounds so far. All men of the prairie spoke
      well of him. The great new lands have codes and standards of morals quite
      their own. One enthusiastic admirer of this youth said, in Jen&rsquo;s hearing,
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Christian&mdash;Val Galbraith!&rdquo; That was the western way of
      announcing a man as having great civic and social virtues. Perhaps the
      respect for Val Galbraith was deepened by the fact that there was no
      broncho or cayuse that he could not tame to the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen turned her face from the flame and looked away from the oasis of
      warmth it made, to where the light shaded away into darkness, a darkness
      that was unbroken for many a score of miles to the north and west. She
      sighed deeply and drew herself up with an aggressive motion as though she
      was freeing herself of something. So she was. She was trying to shake off
      a feeling of oppression. Ten minutes ago the gaslighted house behind her
      had seemed like a prison. She felt that she must have air, space, and
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have liked a long ride on the buffalo-track. That, she felt,
      would clear her mind. She was no romantic creature out of her sphere, no
      exotic. She was country-born and bred, and her blood had been charged by a
      prairie instinct passing through three generations. She was part of this
      life. Her mind was free and strong, and her body was free and healthy.
      While that freedom and health was genial, it revolted against what was
      gross or irregular. She loved horses and dogs, she liked to take a gun and
      ride away to the Poplar Hills in search of game, she found pleasure in
      visiting the Indian Reservation, and talking to Sun-in-the-North, the only
      good Indian chief she knew, or that anyone else on the prairies knew. She
      loved all that was strong and untamed, all that was panting with wild and
      glowing life. Splendidly developed, softly sinewy, warmly bountiful, yet
      without the least physical over-luxuriance or suggestiveness, Jen, with
      her tawny hair and dark-brown eyes, was a growth of unrestrained,
      unconventional, and eloquent life. Like Nature around her, glowing and
      fresh, yet glowing and hardy. There was, however, just a strain of
      pensiveness in her, partly owing to the fact that there were no women near
      her, that she had, virtually, lived her life as a woman alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she thus looked into the undefined horizon two things were happening: a
      traveller was approaching Galbraith&rsquo;s Place from a point in that horizon;
      and in the house behind her someone was singing. The traveller sat erect
      upon his horse. He had not the free and lazy seat of the ordinary
      prairie-rider. It was a cavalry seat, and a military manner. He belonged
      to that handful of men who patrol a frontier of near a thousand miles, and
      are the security of peace in three hundred thousand miles of territory&mdash;the
      Riders of the Plains, the North-West Mounted Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Rider of the Plains was Sergeant Thomas Gellatly, familiarly known as
      Sergeant Tom. Far away as he was he could see that a woman was standing in
      the tavern door. He guessed who it was, and his blood quickened at the
      guessing. But reining his horse on the furthest edge of the lighted
      circle, he said, debatingly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve little time enough to get to the Rise,
      and the order was to go through, hand the information to Inspector Jules,
      and be back within forty-eight hours. Is it flesh and blood they think I
      am? Me that&rsquo;s just come back from a journey of a hundred miles, and sent
      off again like this with but a taste of sleep and little food, and
      Corporal Byng sittin&rsquo; there at Fort Desire with a pipe in his mouth and
      the fat on his back like a porpoise. It&rsquo;s famished I am with hunger, and
      thirty miles yet to do; and she, standin&rsquo; there with a six months&rsquo; welcome
      in her eye.... It&rsquo;s in the interest of Justice if I halt at Galbraith&rsquo;s
      Place for half-an-hour, bedad! The blackguard hid away there at Soldier&rsquo;s
      Knee will be arrested all the sooner; for horse and man will be able the
      better to travel. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s not me that has to take him whoever he is.
      It&rsquo;s little I like leadin&rsquo; a fellow-creature towards the gallows, or
      puttin&rsquo; a bullet into him if he won&rsquo;t come.... Now what will we do, Larry,
      me boy?&rdquo; this to the broncho&mdash;&ldquo;Go on without bite or sup, me achin&rsquo; 
      behind and empty before, and you laggin&rsquo; in the legs, or stay here for the
      slice of an hour and get some heart into us? Stay here is it, me boy? then
      lave go me fut with your teeth and push on to the Prairie Star there.&rdquo; So
      saying, Sergeant Tom, whose language in soliloquy, or when excited, was
      more marked by a brogue than at other times, rode away towards Galbraith&rsquo;s
      Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tavern at that moment, Pretty Pierrre was sitting on the
      bar-counter, where temperance drinks were professedly sold, singing to
      himself. His dress was singularly neat, if coarse, and his slouch hat was
      worn with an air of jauntiness according well with his slight make and
      almost girlish delicacy of complexion. He was puffing a cigarette, in the
      breaks of the song. Peter Galbraith, tall, gaunt, and sombre-looking, sat
      with his chair tilted back against the wall, rather nervously pulling at
      the strips of bark of which the yielding chair-seat was made. He may or
      may not have been listening to the song which had run through several
      verses. Where it had come from, no one knew; no one cared to know. The
      number of its verses were legion. Pierre had a sweet voice, of a
      peculiarly penetrating quality; still it was low and well-modulated, like
      the colour in his cheeks, which gave him his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the words he was singing as Sergeant Tom rode towards the
      tavern:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The hot blood leaps in his quivering breast
        Voila! &lsquo;Tis his enemies near!
     There&rsquo;s a chasm deep on the mountain crest
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!
     They follow him close and they follow him fast,
        And he flies like a mountain deer;
     Then a mad, wild leap and he&rsquo;s safe at last!
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!
     A cry and a leap and the danger&rsquo;s past
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the close of the verse, Galbraith said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that song. I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t like it. You&rsquo;re not a father, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not a father. I have some virtue of that. I have spared the
      world something, Pete Galbraith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the Devil&rsquo;s luck; your sins never get YOU into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A curious fire flashed in the half-breed&rsquo;s eyes, and he said, quietly:
      &ldquo;Yes, I have great luck; but I have my little troubles at times&mdash;at
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re different, though, from this trouble of Val&rsquo;s.&rdquo; There was
      something like a fog in the old man&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Val was quite foolish, you see. If he had killed a white man&mdash;Pretty
      Pierre, for instance&mdash;well, there would have been a show of arrest,
      but he could escape. It was an Injin. The Government cherish the Injin
      much in these days. The redskin must be protected. It must be shown that
      at Ottawa there is justice. That is droll&mdash;quite. Eh, bien! Val will
      not try to escape. He waits too long-near twenty-four hours. Then, it is
      as you see.... You have not told her?&rdquo; He nodded towards the door of the
      sittingroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. It&rsquo;ll come on Jen soon enough if he doesn&rsquo;t get away, and bad
      enough if he does, and can&rsquo;t come back to us. She&rsquo;s fond of him&mdash;as
      fond of him as a mother. Always was wiser than our Val or me, Jen was.
      More sense than a judge, and proud but not too proud, Pierre&mdash;not too
      proud. She knows the right thing to do, like the Scriptures; and she does
      it too.... Where did you say he was hid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Hollow at Soldier&rsquo;s Knee. He stayed too long at Moose Horn. Injins
      carried the news on to Fort Desire. When Val started south for the Border
      other Injins followed, and when a halt was made at Soldier&rsquo;s Knee they
      pushed across country over to Fort Desire. You see, Val&rsquo;s horse give out.
      I rode with him so far. My horse too was broke up. What was to be done?
      Well, I knew a ranchman not far from Soldier&rsquo;s Knee. I told Val to sleep,
      and I would go on and get the ranchman to send him a horse, while I come
      on to you. Then he could push on to the Border. I saw the ranchman, and he
      swore to send a horse to Val to-night. He will keep his word. He knows
      Val. That was at noon to-day, and I am here, you see, and you know all.
      The danger? Ah, my friend,&mdash;the Police Barracks at Archangel&rsquo;s Rise!
      If word is sent down there from Fort Desire before Val passes, they will
      have out a big patrol, and his chances,&mdash;well, you know them, the
      Riders of the Plains. But Val, I think will have luck, and get into
      Montana before they can stop him. I hope; yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could do anything, Pierre! Can&rsquo;t we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed interrupted: &ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t do anything, Galbraith. I have
      done all. The ranchman knows me. He will keep his word, by the Great
      Heaven!&rdquo; It would seem as if Pierre had reasons for relying on the
      ranchman other than ordinary prairie courtesy to law-breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, tell me the whole story over, slow and plain. It don&rsquo;t seem
      nateral to think of it; but if you go over it again, perhaps I can get the
      thing more reas&rsquo;nable in my mind. No, it ain&rsquo;t nateral to me, Pierre&mdash;our
      Val running away.&rdquo; The old man leaned forward and put his elbows on his
      knees and his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, well, it was an Injin. So much. It was in self-defence&mdash;a
      little, but of course to prove that. There is the difficulty. You see,
      they were all drinking, and the Injin&mdash;he was a chief&mdash;-proposed&mdash;he
      proposed that Val should sell him his sister, Jen Galbraith, to be the
      chief&rsquo;s squaw. He would give him a cayuse. Val&rsquo;s blood came up quick&mdash;quite
      quick. You know Val. He said between his teeth: &lsquo;Look out, Snow Devil, you
      Injin dog, or I&rsquo;ll have your heart. Do you think a white girl is like a
      redskin woman, to be sold as you sell your wives and daughters to the
      squaw-men and white loafers, you reptile?&rsquo; Then the Injin said an ugly
      word about Val&rsquo;s sister, and Val shot him dead like lightning.... Yes,
      that is good to swear, Galbraith. You are not the only one that curses the
      law in this world. It is not Justice that fills the gaols, but Law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man rose and walked up and down the room in a shuffling kind of
      way. His best days were done, the spring of his life was gone, and the
      step was that of a man who had little more of activity and force with
      which to turn the halting wheels of life. His face was not altogether
      good, yet it was not evil. There was a sinister droop to the eyelids, a
      suggestion of cruelty about the mouth; but there was more of good-nature
      and passive strength than either in the general expression. One could see
      that some genial influence had dominated what was inherently cruel and
      sinister in him. Still the sinister predisposition was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t never come here, Pierre, can he&rdquo;? he asked, despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he can&rsquo;t come here, Galbraith. And look: if the Riders of the Plains
      should stop here to-night, or to-morrow, you will be cool&mdash;cool, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will be quite cool, Pierre.&rdquo; Then he seemed to think of something
      else and looked up half-curiously, half-inquiringly at the half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre saw this. He whistled quietly to himself for a little, and then
      called the old man over to where he sat. Leaning slightly forward he made
      his reply to the look that had been bent upon him. He touched Galbraith&rsquo;s
      breast lightly with his delicate fingers, and said: &ldquo;I have not much love
      for the world, Pete Galbraith, and not much love for men and women
      altogether; they are fools&mdash;nearly all. Some men&mdash;you know&mdash;treat
      me well. They drink with me&mdash;much. They would make life a hell for me
      if I was poor&mdash;shoot me, perhaps, quick!&mdash;if&mdash;if I didn&rsquo;t
      shoot first. They would wipe me with their feet. They would spoil Pretty
      Pierre.&rdquo; This he said with a grim kind of humour and scorn, refined in its
      suppressed force. Fastidious as he was in appearance, Pierre was not vain.
      He had been created with a sense of refinement that reduced the grossness
      of his life; but he did not trade on it; he simply accepted it and lived
      it naturally after his kind. He was not good at heart, and he never
      pretended to be so. He continued: &ldquo;No, I have not much love; but Val,
      well, I think of him some. His tongue is straight; he makes no lies. His
      heart is fire; his arms are strong; he has no fear. He does not love
      Pierre; but he does not pretend to love him. He does not think of me like
      the rest. So much the more when his trouble comes I help him. I help him
      to the death if he needs me. To make him my friend&mdash;that is good. Eh?
      Perhaps. You see, Galbraith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded thoughtfully, and after a little pause said: &ldquo;I have
      killed Injins myself;&rdquo; and he made a motion of his head backward,
      suggestive of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shrug of his shoulders the other replied &ldquo;Yes, so have I&mdash;sometimes.
      But the government was different then, and there were no Riders of the
      Plains.&rdquo; His white teeth showed menacingly under his slight moustache.
      Then there was another pause. Pierre was watching the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re doing, Galbraith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbin&rsquo; laudanum on my gums for this toothache. Have to use it for
      nuralgy, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith put the little vial back in his waistcoat pocket, and presently
      said: &ldquo;What will you have to drink, Pretty Pierre?&rdquo; That was his way of
      showing gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am reform. I will take coffee, if Jen Galbraith will make some. Too
      much broke glass inside is not good. Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith went into the sitting-room to ask Jen to make the coffee.
      Pierre, still sitting on the bar-counter, sang to himself a verse of a
      rough-and-ready, satirical prairie ballad:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Riders of the Plains, my boys, are twenty thousand strong
     Oh, Lordy, don&rsquo;t they make the prairies howl!
   &lsquo;Tis their lot to smile on virtue and to collar what is wrong,
     And to intercept the happy flowin&rsquo; bowl.

   They&rsquo;ve a notion, that in glory, when we wicked ones have chains
     They will all be major-generals&mdash;and that!
   They&rsquo;re a lovely band of pilgrims are the Riders of the Plains
     Will some sinner please to pass around the hat?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As he reached the last two lines of the verse the door opened and Sergeant
      Tom entered. Pretty Pierre did not stop singing. His eyes simply grew a
      little brighter, his cheek flushed ever so slightly, and there was an
      increase of vigour in the closing notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom smiled a little grimly, then he nodded and said: &ldquo;Been at it
      ever since, Pretty Pierre? You were singing the same song on the same spot
      when I passed here six months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Sergeant Tom, it is you? What brings you so far from your straw-bed
      at Fort Desire?&rdquo; From underneath his hat-brim Pierre scanned the face of
      the trooper closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business. Not to smile on virtue, but to collar what is wrong. I guess
      you ought to be ready by this time to go into quarters, Pierre. You&rsquo;ve had
      a long innings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Sergeant Tom, though I love the Irish, and your company would
      make me happy. But I am so innocent, and the world&mdash;it cannot spare
      me yet. But I think you come to smile on virtue, all the same, Sergeant
      Tom. She is beautiful is Jen Galbraith. Ah, that makes your eye bright&mdash;so!
      You Riders of the Plains, you do two things at one time. You make this
      hour someone happy, and that hour someone unhappy. In one hand the soft
      glove of kindness, in the other, voila! the cold glove of steel. We cannot
      all be great like that, Sergeant Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not great, but clever. Voila, the Pretty Pierre! In one hand he holds the
      soft paper, the pictures that deceive&mdash;kings, queens, and knaves; in
      the other, pictures in gold and silver&mdash;money won from the pockets of
      fools. And so, as you say, &lsquo;bien,&rsquo; and we each have our way, bedad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom noticed that the half-breed&rsquo;s eyes nearly closed, as if to
      hide the malevolence that was in them. He would not have been surprised to
      see a pistol drawn. But he was quite fearless, and if it was not his duty
      to provoke a difficulty, his fighting nature would not shrink from giving
      as good as he got. Besides, so far as that nature permitted, he hated
      Pretty Pierre. He knew the ruin that this gambler had caused here and
      there in the West, and he was glad that Fort Desire, at any rate, knew him
      less than it did formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Peter Galbraith entered with the coffee, followed by Jen. When
      the old man saw his visitor he stood still with sudden fear; but catching
      a warning look from the eye of the half-breed, he made an effort to be
      steady, and said: &ldquo;Well, Jen, if it isn&rsquo;t Sergeant Tom! And what brings
      you down here, Sergeant Tom? After some scalawag that&rsquo;s broke the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom had not noticed the blanched anxiety in the father&rsquo;s face;
      for his eyes were seeking those of the daughter. He answered the question
      as he advanced towards Jen: &ldquo;Yes and no, Galbraith; I&rsquo;m only takin&rsquo; orders
      to those who will be after some scalawag by daylight in the mornin&rsquo;, or
      before. The hand of a traveller to you, Miss Jen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes replied to his in one language; her lips spoke another. &ldquo;And who
      is the law-breaker, Sergeant Tom&rdquo;? she said, as she took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith&rsquo;s eyes strained towards the soldier till the reply came: &ldquo;And I
      don&rsquo;t know that; not wan o&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;d ridden in to Fort Desire from another
      duty, a matter of a hundred miles, whin the major says to me, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
      murder been done at Moose Horn. Take these orders down to Archangel&rsquo;s
      Rise, and deliver them and be back here within forty-eight hours.&rsquo; And
      here I am on the way, and, if I wasn&rsquo;t ready to drop for want of a bite
      and sup, I&rsquo;d be movin&rsquo; away from here to the south at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith was trembling with excitement. Pierre warned him by a look, and
      almost immediately afterward gave him a reassuring nod, as if an important
      and favourable idea had occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen, looking at the Sergeant&rsquo;s handsome face, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s six months to a
      day since you were here, Sergeant Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an almanac you are, Miss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre sipping his coffee here interrupted musingly: &ldquo;But her
      almanac is not always so reliable. So I think. When was I here last,
      Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With something like menace in her eyes Jen replied: &ldquo;You were here six
      months ago to-day, when you won thirty dollars from our Val; and then
      again, just thirty days after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so! You remember with a difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment after, Sergeant Tom being occupied in talking to Jen, Pierre
      whispered to Peter Galbraith: &ldquo;His horse&mdash;then the laudanum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith was puzzled for a moment, but soon nodded significantly, and the
      sinister droop to his eyes became more marked. He turned to the Sergeant
      and said, &ldquo;Your horse must be fed as well as yourself, Sergeant Tom. I&rsquo;ll
      look after the beast, and Jen will take care of you. There&rsquo;s some fresh
      coffee, isn&rsquo;t there, Jen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen nodded an affirmative. Galbraith knew that the Sergeant would trust no
      one to feed his horse but himself, and the offer therefore was made with
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom replied instantly: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll do it if someone will show me
      the grass pile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre slipped quietly from the counter, and said, &ldquo;I know the way,
      Galbraith. I will show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen turned to the sitting-room, and Sergeant Tom moved to the tavern door,
      followed by Pierre, who, as he passed Galbraith, touched the old man&rsquo;s
      waistcoat pocket, and said: &ldquo;Thirty drops in the coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he passed out, singing softly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And he sleepeth so well, and he sleepeth so long
        The fight it was hard, my dear;
     And his foes were many and swift and strong
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was danger ahead for Sergeant Thomas Gellatly. Galbraith followed
      his daughter to the sitting-room. She went to the kitchen and brought
      bread, and cold venison, and prairie fowl, and stewed dried apples&mdash;the
      stay and luxury of all rural Canadian homes. The coffee-pot was then
      placed on the table. Then the old man said: &ldquo;Better give him some of that
      old cheese, Jen, hadn&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s in the cellar.&rdquo; He wanted to be rid of
      her for a few moments. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I had,&rdquo; and Jen vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was Galbraith&rsquo;s chance. He took the vial of laudanum from his pocket,
      and opened the coffee-pot. It was half full. This would not suit. Someone
      else&mdash;Jen&mdash;might drink the coffee also! Yet it had to be done.
      Sergeant Tom should not go on. Inspector Jules and his Riders of the
      Plains must not be put upon the track of Val. Twelve hours would make all
      the difference. Pour out a cup of coffee?&mdash;Yes, of course, that would
      do. It was poured out quickly, and then thirty drops of laudanum were
      carefully counted into it. Hark, they are coming back!&mdash;Just in time.
      Sergeant Tom and Pierre enter from outside, and then Jen from the kitchen.
      Galbraith is pouring another cup of coffee as they enter, and he says:
      &ldquo;Just to be sociable I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to have a cup of coffee with you, Sergeant
      Tom. How you Riders of the Plains get waited on hand and foot!&rdquo; Did some
      warning flash through Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s mind or body, some mental shock or
      some physical chill? For he distinctly shivered, though he was not cold.
      He seemed suddenly oppressed with a sense of danger. But his eyes fell on
      Jen, and the hesitation, for which he did not then try to account, passed.
      Jen, clear-faced and true, invited him to sit and eat, and he, starting
      half-abstractedly, responded to her &ldquo;Draw nigh, Sergeant Tom,&rdquo; and sat
      down. Commonplace as the words were, they thrilled him, for he thought of
      a table of his own in a home of his own, and the same words spoken
      everyday, but without the &ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo;&mdash;simply &ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ate heartily and sipped his coffee slowly, talking meanwhile to Jen and
      Galbraith. Pretty Pierre watched them all. Presently the gambler said:
      &ldquo;Let us go and have our game of euchre, Galbraith. Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle can well
      take care of Sergeant Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith drank the rest of his coffee, rose, and passed with Pierre into
      the bar-room. Then the halfbreed said to him, &ldquo;You were careful&mdash;thirty
      drops?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thirty drops.&rdquo; The latent cruelty of the old man&rsquo;s nature was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. It is sleep; not death. He will sleep so sound for half a
      day, perhaps eighteen hours, and then!&mdash;Val will have a long start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the sitting-room Sergeant Tom was saying: &ldquo;Where is your brother, Miss
      Galbraith?&rdquo; He had no idea that the order in his pocket was for the arrest
      of that brother. He merely asked the question to start the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Jen had met but five or six times; but the impression left on the
      minds of both was pleasant&mdash;ineradicable. Yet, as Sergeant Tom often
      asked himself during the past six months, why should he think of her? The
      life he led was one of severe endurance, and harshness, and austerity.
      Into it there could not possibly enter anything of home. He was but a
      noncommissioned officer of the Mounted Police, and beyond that he had
      nothing. Ireland had not been kind to him. He had left her inhospitable
      shores, and after years of absence he had but a couple of hundred dollars
      laid up&mdash;enough to purchase his discharge and something over, but
      nothing with which to start a home. Ranching required capital. No, it
      couldn&rsquo;t be thought of; and yet he had thought of it, try as he would not
      to do so. And she? There was that about this man who had lived life on two
      continents, in whose blood ran the warm and chivalrous Celtic fire, which
      appealed to her. His physical manhood was noble, if rugged; his
      disposition genial and free, if schooled, but not entirely, to that
      reserve which his occupation made necessary&mdash;a reserve he would have
      been more careful to maintain, in speaking of his mission a short time
      back in the bar-room, if Jen had not been there. She called out the
      frankest part of him; she opened the doors of his nature; she attracted
      confidence as the sun does the sunflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his question she replied: &ldquo;I do not know where our Val is. He went on a
      hunting expedition up north. We never can tell about him, when he will
      turn up or where he will be to-morrow. He may walk in any minute. We never
      feel uneasy. He always has such luck, and comes out safe and sound
      wherever he is. Father says Val&rsquo;s a hustler, and that nothing can keep in
      the road with him. But he&rsquo;s a little wild&mdash;a little. Still, we don&rsquo;t
      hector him, Sergeant Tom; hectoring never does any good, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, hectoring never does any good. And as for the wildness, if the heart
      of him&rsquo;s right, why that&rsquo;s easy out of him whin he&rsquo;s older. It&rsquo;s a fine
      lad I thought him, the time I saw him here. It&rsquo;s his freedom I wish I had&mdash;me
      that has to travel all day and part of the night, and thin part of the day
      and all night back again, and thin a day of sleep and the same thing over
      again. And that&rsquo;s the life of me, sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; of the frost and the
      blizzards, and no home to go to, and no one to have a meal for me like
      this whin I turn up.&rdquo; And the sergeant wound up with, &ldquo;Whooroo! there&rsquo;s a
      speech for you, Miss!&rdquo; and laughed good-humouredly. For all that, there
      was in his eyes an appeal that went straight to Jen&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, woman-like, she would not open the way for him to say anything more
      definite just yet. She turned the subject. And yet again, woman-like, she
      knew it would lead to the same conclusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing would keep you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Duty is duty, much as I&rsquo;d like to stay, and you givin&rsquo; me the
      bid. But my orders were strict. You don&rsquo;t know what discipline means,
      perhaps. It means obeyin&rsquo; commands if you die for it; and my commands were
      to take a letter to Inspector Jules at Archangel&rsquo;s Rise to-night. It&rsquo;s a
      matter of murder or the like, and duty must be done, and me that sleepy,
      not forgettin&rsquo; your presence, as ever a man was and looked the world in
      the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank the rest of the coffee and mechanically set the cup down, his
      eyes closing heavily as he did so. He made an effort, however, and pulled
      himself together. His eyes opened, and he looked at Jen steadily for a
      moment. Then he leaned over and touched her hand gently with his fingers,&mdash;Pierre&rsquo;s
      glove of kindness,&mdash;and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my heart to want to stay; but
      a sight of you I&rsquo;ll have on my way back. But I must go on now, though I&rsquo;m
      that drowsy I could lie down here and never stir again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen said to herself: &ldquo;Poor fellow, poor fellow, how tired he is! I wish&rdquo;&mdash;but
      she withdrew her hand. He put his hand to his head, and said, absently:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my duty and it&rsquo;s orders, and... what was I sayin&rsquo;? The disgrace of
      me if, if... bedad! the sleep&rsquo;s on me; I&rsquo;m awake, but I can&rsquo;t open my
      eyes.... If the orders of me&mdash;and a good meal... and the disgrace...
      to do me duty-looked the world in the face&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech he staggered to his feet, Jen watching him anxiously
      the while. No suspicion of the cause of his trouble crossed her mind. She
      set it down to extreme natural exhaustion. Presently feeling the sofa
      behind him, he dropped upon it, and, falling back, began to breathe
      heavily. But even in this physical stupefaction he made an effort to
      reassert himself, to draw himself back from the coming unconsciousness.
      His eyes opened, but they were blind with sleep; and as if in a dream, he
      said: &ldquo;My duty... disgrace... a long sleep... Jen, dearest&rdquo;&mdash;how she
      started then!&mdash;&ldquo;it must be done... my Jen!&rdquo; and he said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these few words had opened up a world for her&mdash;a new-created
      world on the instant. Her life was illuminated. She felt the fulness of a
      great thought suffusing her face. A beautiful dream was upon her. It had
      come to her out of his sleep. But with its splendid advent there came the
      other thing that always is born with woman&rsquo;s love&mdash;an almost pathetic
      care of the being loved. In the deep love of women the maternal and
      protective sense works in the parallels of mutual regard. In her life now
      it sprang full-statured in action; love of him, care of him; his honour
      her honour; his life her life. He must not sleep like this if it was his
      duty to go on. Yet how utterly worn he must be! She had seen men brought
      in from fighting prairie fires for three days without sleep; had watched
      them drop on their beds, and lie like logs for thirty-six hours. This
      sleep of her lover was, therefore, not so strange to her but it was
      perilous to the performance of his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Sergeant Tom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Poor Tom,&rdquo; she added; and then, with a
      great flutter at the heart at last, &ldquo;My Tom!&rdquo; Yes, she said that; but she
      said it to the beacon, to the Prairie Star, burning outside brighter, it
      seemed to her, than it had ever done be fore. Then she sat down and
      watched him for many minutes, thinking at the end of each that she would
      wake him. But the minutes passed, his breathing grew heavier, and he did
      not stir. The Prairie Star made quivering and luminous curtains of red for
      the windows, and Jen&rsquo;s mind was quivering in vivid waves of feeling just
      the same. It seemed to her as if she was looking at life now through an
      atmosphere charged with some rare, refining essence, and that in it she
      stood exultingly. Perhaps she did not define it so; but that which we
      define she felt. And happy are they who feel it, and, feeling it, do not
      lose it in this world, and have the hope of carrying it into the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she rose, went over to him and touched his shoulder. It
      seemed strange to her to do this thing. She drew back timidly from the
      pleasant shock of a new experience. Then she remembered that he ought to
      be on his way, and she shook him gently, then, with all her strength, and
      called to him quietly all the time, as if her low tones ought to wake him,
      if nothing else could. But he lay in a deep and stolid slumber. It was no
      use. She went to her seat and sat down to think. As she did so, her father
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you call, Jen&rdquo;? he said; and turned to the sofa. &ldquo;I was calling to
      Sergeant Tom. He&rsquo;s asleep there; dead-gone, father. I can&rsquo;t wake him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you wake him? He is tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sinister lines in Galbraith&rsquo;s face had deepened greatly in the last
      hour. He went over and looked closely at the Sergeant, followed languidly
      by Pierre, who casually touched the pulse of the sleeping man, and said as
      casually:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, he sleep well; his pulse is like a baby; he was tired, much. He has
      had no sleep for one, two, three nights, perhaps; and a good meal, it
      makes him comfortable, and so you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he touched lightly the triple chevron on Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s arm, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, a man does much work for that. And then, to be moral and the friend
      of the law all the time!&rdquo; Pierre here shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It is
      easier to be wicked and free, and spend when one is rich, and starve when
      one is poor, than to be a sergeant and wear the triple chevron. But the
      sleep will do him good just the same, Jen Galbraith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that he must go to Archangel&rsquo;s Rise tonight, and be back at Fort
      Desire to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s nothing to us, Jen,&rdquo; replied Galbraith, roughly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
      his own business to look after. He and his tribe are none too good to us
      and our tribe. He&rsquo;d have your old father up to-morrow for selling a tired
      traveller a glass of brandy; and worse than that, ay, a great sight worse
      than that, mind you, Jen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen did not notice, or, at least, did not heed, the excited emphasis on
      the last words. She thought that perhaps her father had been set against
      the Sergeant by Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;ll do, father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to bark at a dead lion.
      Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s asleep, and you say things that you wouldn&rsquo;t say if he was
      awake. He never did us any harm, and you know that&rsquo;s true, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith was about to reply with anger; but he changed his mind and
      walked into the bar-room, followed by Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Jen&rsquo;s mind a scheme had been hurriedly and clearly formed; and with
      her, to form it was to put it into execution. She went to Sergeant Tom,
      opened his coat, felt in the inside pocket, and drew forth an official
      envelope. It was addressed to Inspector Jules at Archangel&rsquo;s Rise. She put
      it back and buttoned up the coat again. Then she said, with her hands
      firmly clenching at her side,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the adjoining room and got a quilt, which she threw over
      him, and a pillow, which she put under his head. Then she took his cap and
      the cloak which he had thrown over a chair, as if to carry them away. But
      another thought occurred to her, for she looked towards the bar-room and
      put them down again. She glanced out of the window and saw that her father
      and Pierre had gone to lessen the volume of gas which was feeding the
      flame. This, she knew, meant that her father would go to bed when he came
      back to the house; and this suited her purpose. She waited till they had
      entered the bar-room again, and then she went to them, and said: &ldquo;I guess
      he&rsquo;s asleep for all night. Best leave him where he is. I&rsquo;m going.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she got back to the sitting-room she said to herself: &ldquo;How old
      father&rsquo;s looking! He seems broken up to-day. He isn&rsquo;t what he used to be.&rdquo;
       She turned once more to look at Sergeant Tom, then she went to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Peter Galbraith and Pretty Pierre went to the sitting-room,
      and the old man drew from the Sergeant&rsquo;s pocket the envelope which Jen had
      seen. Pierre took it from him. &ldquo;No, Pete Galbraith. Do not be a fool.
      Suppose you steal that paper. Sergeant Tom will miss it. He will
      understand. He will guess about the drug, then you will be in trouble. Val
      will be safe now. This Rider of the Plains will sleep long enough for
      that. There, I put the paper back. He sleeps like a log. No one can
      suspect the drug, and it is all as we like. No, we will not steal; that is
      wrong&mdash;quite wrong&rdquo;&mdash;here Pretty Pierre showed his teeth. &ldquo;We
      will go to bed. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen heard them ascend the stairs. She waited a half-hour, then she stole
      into Val&rsquo;s bedroom, and when she emerged again she had a bundle of clothes
      across her arm. A few minutes more and she walked into the sitting-room
      dressed in Val&rsquo;s clothes, and with her hair closely wound on the top of
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was still. The Prairie Star made the room light enough for her
      purpose. She took Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s cap and cloak and put them on. She drew
      the envelope from his pocket and put it in her bosom&mdash;she showed the
      woman there, though for the rest of this night she was to be a Rider of
      the Plains, She of the Triple Chevron.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went towards the door, hesitated, drew back, then paused, stooped down
      quickly, tenderly touched the soldier&rsquo;s brow with her lips, and said:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it for you. You shall not be disgraced&mdash;Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      This was at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock. At two o&rsquo;clock a jaded and blown horse
      stood before the door of the barracks at Archangel&rsquo;s Rise. Its rider,
      muffled to the chin, was knocking, and at the same time pulling his cap
      down closely over his head. &ldquo;Thank God the night is dusky,&rdquo; he said. We
      have heard that voice before. The hat and cloak are those of Sergeant Tom,
      but the voice is that of Jen Galbraith. There is some danger in this act;
      danger for her lover, contempt for herself if she is discovered. Presently
      the door opens and a corporal appears. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? Oh,&rdquo; he added, as he
      caught sight of the familiar uniform; &ldquo;where from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Fort Desire. Important orders to Inspector Jules. Require fresh
      horse to return with; must leave mine here. Have to go back at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said the corporal, taking the papers&mdash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gellatly&mdash;Sergeant Gellatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Sergeant Gellatly, this isn&rsquo;t accordin&rsquo; to Hoyle&mdash;come in the
      night and go in the night and not stay long enough to have a swear at the
      Gover&rsquo;ment. Why, you&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; in, aren&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; across the
      door-mat for a cup of coffee and a warm while the horse is gettin&rsquo; ready,
      aren&rsquo;t you, Sergeant&mdash;Sergeant Gellatly, Sergeant Gellatly? I&rsquo;ve
      heard of you, but&mdash;yes; I will hurry. Here, Waugh, this to Inspector
      Jules! If you won&rsquo;t step in and won&rsquo;t drink and will be unsociable,
      sergeant, why, come on and you shall have a horse as good as the one
      you&rsquo;ve brought. I&rsquo;m Corporal Galna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen led the exhausted horse to the stables. Fortunately there was no
      lantern used, and therefore little chance for the garrulous corporal to
      study the face of his companion, even if he wished to do so. The risk was
      considerable; but Jen Galbraith was fired by that spirit of self-sacrifice
      which has held a world rocking to destruction on a balancing point of
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse was quickly saddled, Jen meanwhile remaining silent. While she
      was mounting, Corporal Galna drew and struck a match to light his pipe. He
      held it up for a moment as though to see the face of Sergeant Gellatly.
      Jen had just given a good-night, and the horse the word and a touch of the
      spur at the instant. Her face, that is, such of it as could be seen above
      the cloak and under the cap, was full in the light. Enough was seen,
      however, to call forth, in addition to Corporal Galna&rsquo;s good-night, the
      exclamation, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Jen vanished into the night a moment after, she heard a voice calling&mdash;not
      Corporal Galna&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;Sergeant Gellatly, Sergeant Gellatly!&rdquo; She
      supposed it was Inspector Jules, but she would not turn back now. Her work
      was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later Corporal Galna confided to Private Waugh that Sergeant
      Gellatly was too damned pretty for the force&mdash;wondered if they called
      him Beauty at Fort Desire&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t call him Pretty Gellatly, for
      there was Pretty Pierre who had right of possession to that title&mdash;would
      like to ask him what soap he used for his complexion&mdash;&lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t this
      yellow bar-soap of the barracks, which wouldn&rsquo;t lather, he&rsquo;d bet his
      ultimate dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waugh, who had sometime seen Sergeant Gellatly, entered into a disputation
      on the point. He said that &ldquo;Sergeant Tom was good-looking, a regular Irish
      thoroughbred; but he wasn&rsquo;t pretty, not much!&mdash;guessed Corporal Galna
      had nightmare, and finally, as the interest in the theme increased in
      fervour, announced that Sergeant Tom could loosen the teeth of, and knock
      the spots off, any man among the Riders, from Archangel&rsquo;s Rise to the
      Cypress Hills. Pretty&mdash;not much&mdash;thoroughbred all over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Corporal Galna replied, sarcastically,&mdash;&ldquo;That he might be able
      for spot dispersion of such a kind, but he had two as pretty spots on his
      cheek, and as white and touch-no-tobacco teeth as any female ever had.&rdquo;
       Private Waugh declared then that Corporal Galna would be saying Sergeant
      Gellatly wasn&rsquo;t a man at all, and wore earrings, and put his hair into
      papers; and when he could find no further enlargement of sarcasm,
      consigned the Corporal to a fiery place of future torment reserved for
      lunatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical juncture Waugh was ordered to proceed to Inspector Jules.
      A few minutes after, he was riding away toward Soldier&rsquo;s Knee, with the
      Inspector and another private, to capture Val Galbraith, the slayer of
      Snow Devil, while four other troopers also started off in different
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six o&rsquo;clock when Jen drew rein in the yard at Galbraith&rsquo;s Place.
      Through the dank humours of the darkest time of the night she had watched
      the first grey streaks of dawn appear. She had caught her breath with fear
      at the thought that, by some accident, she might not get back before seven
      o&rsquo;clock, the hour when her father rose. She trembled also at the
      supposition of Sergeant Tom awaking and finding his papers gone. But her
      fearfulness and excitement was not that of weakness, rather that of a
      finely nervous nature, having strong elements of imagination, and,
      therefore, great capacities for suffering as for joy; but yet elastic,
      vigorous, and possessing unusual powers of endurance. Such natures rebuild
      as fast as they are exhausted. In the devitalising time preceding the dawn
      she had felt a sudden faintness come over her for a moment; but her will
      surmounted it, and, when she saw the ruddy streaks of pink and red glorify
      the horizon, she felt a sudden exaltation of physical strength. She was a
      child of the light, she loved the warm flame of the sun, the white gleam
      of the moon. Holding in her horse to give him a five minutes&rsquo; rest, she
      rose in her saddle and looked round. She was alone in her circle of
      vision, she and her horse. The long hillocks of prairie rolled away like
      the sea to the flushed morning, and the far-off Cypress Hills broke the
      monotonous skyline of the south. Already the air was dissipated of its
      choking weight, and the vast solitude was filling with that sense of
      freedom which night seems to shut in as with four walls, and day to widen
      gloriously. Tears sprang to her eyes from a sudden rush of feeling; but
      her lips were smiling. The world was so different from what it was
      yesterday. Something had quickened her into a glowing life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she urged the horse on, and never halted till she reached home. She
      unsaddled the animal that had shared with her the hardship of the long,
      hard ride, hobbled it, and entered the house quickly. No one was stirring.
      Sergeant Tom was still asleep. This she saw, as she hurriedly passed in
      and laid the cap and cloak where she had found them. Then, once again, she
      touched the brow of the sleeper with her lips, and went to her room to
      divest herself of Val&rsquo;s clothes. The thing had been done without anyone
      knowing of her absence. But she was frightened as she looked into the
      mirror. She was haggard, and her eyes were bloodshot. Eight hours or
      nearly in the saddle, at ten miles an hour, had told on her severely; as
      well it might. Even a prairie-born woman, however, understands the art and
      use of grooming better than a man. Warm water quickly heated at the gas,
      with a little acetic acid in it, used generally for her scouring,&mdash;and
      then cold water with oatmeal flour, took away in part the dulness and the
      lines in the flesh. But the eyes! Jen remembered the vial of tincture of
      myrrh left by a young Englishman a year ago, and used by him for
      refreshing his eyes after a drinking bout. She got it, tried the tincture,
      and saw and felt an immediate benefit. Then she made a cup of strong green
      tea, and in ten minutes was like herself again. Now for the horse. She
      went quickly out where she could not be seen from the windows of the
      house, and gave him a rubbing down till he was quite dry. Then she gave
      him a little water and some feed. The horse was really the touchstone of
      discovery. But Jen trusted in her star. If the worst came she would tell
      the tale. It must be told anyway to Sergeant Tom&mdash;but that was
      different now. Even if the thing became known it would only be a thing to
      be teased about by her father and others, and she could stop that. Poor
      girl, as though that was the worst that was to come from her act!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom slept deeply and soundly. He had not stirred. His breathing
      was unnaturally heavy, Jen thought, but, no suspicion of foul play came to
      her mind yet. Why should it? She gave herself up to a sweet and simple
      sense of pride in the deed she had done for him, disturbed but slightly by
      the chances of discovery, and the remembrance of the match that showed her
      face at Archangel&rsquo;s Rise. Her hands touched the flaxen hair of the
      soldier, and her eyes grew luminous. One night had stirred all her soul to
      its depths. A new woman had been born in her. Val was dear to her&mdash;her
      brother Val; but she realised now that another had come who would occupy a
      place that neither father, nor brother, nor any other could fill. Yet it
      was a most weird set of tragic circumstances. This man before her had been
      set to do a task which might deprive her brother of his life, certainly of
      his freedom; that would disgrace him; her father had done a great wrong
      too, had put in danger the life of the man she loved, to save his son; she
      herself in doing this deed for her lover had placed her brother in
      jeopardy, had crossed swords with her father&rsquo;s purposes, had done the one
      thing that stood between that father&rsquo;s son and safety; Pretty Pierre, whom
      she hated and despised, and thought to be the enemy of her brother and of
      her home, had proved himself a friend; and behind it all was the brother&rsquo;s
      crime committed to avenge an insult to her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such is life. Men and women are unwittingly their own executioners,
      and the executioners of those they love.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, and then Galbraith and Pierre appeared. Jen noticed that
      her father went over to Sergeant Tom and rather anxiously felt his pulse.
      Once in the night the old man had come down and done the same thing.
      Pierre said something in an undertone. Did they think he was ill? That was
      Jon&rsquo;s thought. She watched them closely; but the half-breed knew that she
      was watching, and the two said nothing more to each other. But Pierre
      said, in a careless way: &ldquo;It is good he have that sleep. He was played
      out, quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jon replied, a secret triumph at her heart: &ldquo;But what about his orders,
      the papers he was to carry to Archangel&rsquo;s Rise? What about his being back
      at Fort Desire in the time given him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not much matter about the papers. The poor devil that Inspector
      Jules would arrest&mdash;well, he will get off, perhaps, but that does no
      one harm. Eh, Galbraith? The law is sometimes unkind. And as for obeying
      orders, why, the prairie is wide, it is a hard ride, horses go wrong;&mdash;a
      little tale of trouble to Inspector Jules, another at Fort Desire, and who
      is to know except Pete Galbraith, Jen Galbraith, and Pierre? Poor Sergeant
      Tom. It was good he sleep so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen felt there was irony behind the smooth words of the gambler. He had a
      habit of saying things, as they express it in that country, between his
      teeth. That signifies what is animal-like and cruel. Galbraith stood
      silent during Pierre&rsquo;s remarks, but, when he had finished, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right if he doesn&rsquo;t sleep too long; but there&rsquo;s the trouble&mdash;too
      long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre frowned a warning, and then added, with unconcern: &ldquo;I remember when
      you sleep thirty hours, Galbraith&mdash;after the prairie fire, three
      years ago, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s so; that&rsquo;s so as you say it. We&rsquo;ll let him sleep till noon,
      or longer&mdash;or longer, won&rsquo;t we, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, till noon is good, or longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he shall not sleep longer if I can wake him,&rdquo; said Jen. &ldquo;You do not
      think of the trouble all this sleeping may make for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then&mdash;but then, there is the trouble he will make for others, if
      he wakes. Think. A poor devil trying to escape the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have nothing to do with that, and justice is justice, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, well, perhaps, perhaps!&rdquo; Galbraith was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen felt that so far as Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s papers were concerned he was safe;
      but she felt also that by noon he ought to be on his way back to Fort
      Desire&mdash;after she had told him what she had done. She was anxious for
      his honour. That her lover shall appear well before the world, is a thing
      deep in the heart of every woman. It is a pride for which she will deny
      herself, even of the presence of that lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till noon,&rdquo; Jen said, &ldquo;and then he must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen watched to see if her father or Pierre would notice that the horse was
      changed, had been travelled during the night, or that it was a different
      one altogether. As the morning wore away she saw that they did not notice
      the fact. This ignorance was perhaps owing largely to the appearance of
      several ranchmen from near the American border. They spent their time in
      the bar-room, and when they left it was nearly noon. Still Sergeant Tom
      slept. Jen now went to him and tried to wake him. She lifted him to a
      sitting position, but his head fell on her shoulder. Disheartened, she
      laid him down again. But now at last an undefined suspicion began to take
      possession of her. It made her uneasy; it filled her with a vague sense of
      alarm. Was this sleep natural? She remembered that, when her father and
      others had slept so long after the prairie fire, she had waked them once
      to give them drink and a little food, and they did not breathe so heavily
      as he was doing. Yet what could be done? What was the matter? There was
      not a doctor nearer than a hundred miles. She thought of bleeding,&mdash;the
      old-fashioned remedy still used on the prairies&mdash;but she decided to
      wait a little. Somehow she felt that she would receive no help from her
      father or Pierre. Had they anything to do with this sleep? Was it
      connected with the papers? No, not that, for they had not sought to take
      them, and had not made any remark about their being gone. This showed
      their unconcern on that point. She could not fathom the mystery, but the
      suspicion of something irregular deepened. Her father could have no reason
      for injuring Sergeant Tom; but Pretty Pierre&mdash;that was another
      matter. Yet she remembered too that her father had appeared the more
      anxious of the two about the Sergeant&rsquo;s sleep. She recalled that he said:
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right, if he doesn&rsquo;t sleep too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pierre could play a part, she knew, and could involve others in
      trouble, and escape himself. He was a man with a reputation for occasional
      wickednesses of a naked, decided type. She knew that he was possessed of a
      devil, of a very reserved devil, but liable to bold action on occasions.
      She knew that he valued the chances of life or death no more than he
      valued the thousand and one other chances of small importance, which occur
      in daily experience. It was his creed that one doesn&rsquo;t go till the game is
      done and all the cards are played. He had a stoic indifference to events.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might be capable of poisoning&mdash;poisoning! ah, that thought! of
      poisoning Sergeant Tom for some cause. But her father? The two seemed to
      act alike in the matter. Could her father approve of any harm happening to
      Tom? She thought of the meal he had eaten, of the coffee he had drunk. The
      coffee-was that the key? But she said to herself that she was foolish,
      that her love had made her so. No, it could not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a fear grew upon her, strive as she would against it. She waited
      silently and watched, and twice or thrice made ineffectual efforts to
      rouse him. Her father came in once. He showed anxiety; that was
      unmistakable, but was it the anxiety of guilt of any kind? She said
      nothing. At five o&rsquo;clock matters abruptly came to a climax. Jen was in the
      kitchen, but, hearing footsteps in the sitting-room, she opened the door
      quietly. Her father was bending over Sergeant Tom, and Pierre was
      speaking: &ldquo;No, no, Galbraith, it is all right. You are a fool. It could
      not kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill him&mdash;kill him,&rdquo; she repeated gaspingly to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see he was exhausted; he may sleep for hours yet. Yes, he is safe, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Jen, she suspects something, she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Pretty Pierre. He saw her standing near. She had glided
      forward and stood with flashing eyes turned, now upon the one, and now
      upon the other. Finally they rested on Galbraith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you have done to him; what you and Pretty Pierre have done
      to him. You have some secret. I will know.&rdquo; She leaned forward, something
      of the tigress in the poise of her body. &ldquo;I tell you, I will know.&rdquo; Her
      voice was low, and vibrated with fierceness and determination. Her eyes
      glowed, and her nostrils trembled with disdain and indignation. As they
      drew back,&mdash;the old man sullenly, the gambler with a slight gesture
      of impatience,&mdash;she came a step nearer to them and waited, the cords
      of her shapely throat swelling with excitement. A moment so, and then she
      said in a tone that suggested menace, determination:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have poisoned him. Tell me the truth. Do you hear, father&mdash;the
      truth, or I will hate you. I will make you repent it till you die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Pierre began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. &ldquo;Do not speak, Pretty Pierre. You are a devil. You
      will lie. Father&mdash;!&rdquo; She waited. &ldquo;What difference does it make to
      you, Jen?&rdquo; &ldquo;What difference&mdash;what difference to me? That you should
      be a murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not so, that is a dream of yours, Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle,&rdquo; said Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her father again. &ldquo;Father, will you tell the truth to me? I
      warn you it will be better for you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s brow was sullen, and his lips were twitching nervously. &ldquo;You
      care more for him than you do for your own flesh and blood, Jen. There&rsquo;s
      nothing to get mad about like that. I&rsquo;ll tell you when he&rsquo;s gone. ...
      Let&rsquo;s&mdash;let&rsquo;s wake him,&rdquo; he added, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped down and lifted the sleeping man to a sitting posture. Pierre
      assisted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen saw that the half-breed believed Sergeant Tom could be wakened, and
      her fear diminished slightly, if her indignation did not. They lifted the
      soldier to his feet. Pierre pressed the point of a pin deep into his arm.
      Jen started forward, woman-like, to check the action, but drew back, for
      she saw heroic measures might be necessary to bring him to consciousness.
      But, nevertheless, her anger broke bounds, and she said: &ldquo;Cowards&mdash;cowards!
      What spite made you do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation, Jen,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll hector me till I make you
      sorry. What&rsquo;s this Irish policeman to you? What&rsquo;s he beside your own flesh
      and blood, I say again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does my own flesh and blood do such wicked tricks to an Irish
      soldier? Why does it give poison to an Irish soldier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison, Jen? You needn&rsquo;t speak so ghost-like. It was only a dose of
      laudanum; not enough to kill him. Ask Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly she believed him, and said a Thank-God to herself, but to the
      half-breed she remarked: &ldquo;Yes, ask Pierre&mdash;you are behind all this!
      It is some evil scheme of yours. Why did you do it? Tell the truth for
      once.&rdquo; Her eyes swam angrily with Pierre&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was complacent; he admired her wild attacks. He smiled, and
      replied: &ldquo;My dear, it was a whim of mine; but you need not tell him, all
      the same, when he wakes. You see this is your father&rsquo;s house, though the
      whim is mine. But look: he is waking-the pin is good. Some cold water,
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cold water was brought and dashed into the face of the soldier. He
      showed signs of returning consciousness. The effect of the laudanum had
      been intensified by the thoroughly exhausted condition of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man was perfectly healthy, and this helped to resist the danger of
      a fatal result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre kept up an intermittent speech. &ldquo;Yes, it was a mere whim of mine.
      Eh, he will think he has been an ass to sleep so long, and on duty, and
      orders to carry to Archangel&rsquo;s Rise!&rdquo; Here he showed his teeth again,
      white and regular like a dog&rsquo;s. That was the impression they gave, his
      lips were so red, and the contrast was so great. One almost expected to
      find that the roof of his mouth was black, like that of a well-bred hound;
      but there is no evidence available on the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that is good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now set him down, Pete Galbraith. Yes&mdash;so,
      so! Sergeant Tom, ah, you will wake well, soon. Now the eyes a little
      wider. Good. Eh, Sergeant Tom, what is the matter? It is breakfast time&mdash;quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s eyes opened slowly and looked dazedly before him for a
      minute. Then they fell on Pierre. At first there was no recognition, then
      they became consciously clearer. &ldquo;Pretty Pierre, you here in the
      barracks!&rdquo; he said. He put his hand to his head, then rubbed his eyes
      roughly and looked up again. This time he saw Jen and her father. His
      bewilderment increased. Then he added: &ldquo;What is the matter? Have I been
      asleep? What&mdash;!&rdquo; He remembered. He staggered to his feet and felt his
      pockets quickly and anxiously for his letter. It was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My orders! Who has robbed me? Faith, I remember. I
      could not keep awake after I drank the coffee. My papers are gone, I tell
      you, Galbraith,&rdquo; he said, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Jen: &ldquo;You are not in this, Jen. Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, then was about to answer, when he turned to
      the gambler and said: &ldquo;You are at the bottom of this. Give me my papers.&rdquo;
       But Pierre and Galbraith were as dumbfounded as the Sergeant himself to
      know that the letter was gone. They were stunned beyond speech when Jen
      said, flushing: &ldquo;No, Sergeant Tom, I am the thief. When I could not wake
      you, I took the letter from your pocket and carried it to Inspector Jules
      last night,&mdash;or, rather, Sergeant Gellatly carried them. I wore his
      cap and cloak and passed for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You carried that letter to Inspector Jules last night, Jen&rdquo;? said the
      soldier, all his heart in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen saw her father blanch, his mouth open blankly, and his lips refuse to
      utter the words on them. For the first time she comprehended some danger
      to him, to herself&mdash;to Val!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father,&rdquo; she said,&mdash;&ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre shrugged his shoulders and rejoined: &ldquo;Eh, the devil! Such mistakes
      of women. They are fools&mdash;all.&rdquo; The old man put out a shaking hand
      and caught his daughter&rsquo;s arm. His look was of mingled wonder and despair,
      as he said, in a gasping whisper, &ldquo;You carried that letter to Archangel&rsquo;s
      Rise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, faltering now; &ldquo;Sergeant Tom had said how important
      it was, you remember. That it was his duty to take it to Inspector Jules,
      and be back within forty-eight hours. He fell asleep. I could not wake
      him. I thought, what if he were my brother&mdash;our Val. So, when you and
      Pretty Pierre went to bed, I put on Val&rsquo;s clothes, took Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s
      cloak and hat, carried the orders to Jules, and was back here by six
      o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom&rsquo;s eyes told his tale of gratitude. He made a step towards
      her; but the old man, with a strange ferocity, motioned him back, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away from this house. Go quick. Go now, I tell you, or by God,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Pretty Pierre touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom drew back, not because he feared but as if to get a mental
      perspective of the situation. Galbraith again said to his daughter,&mdash;&ldquo;Jen,
      you carried them papers? You! for him&mdash;for the Law!&rdquo; Then he turned
      from her, and with hand clenched and teeth set spoke to the soldier:
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard enough? Curse you, why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom replied coolly: &ldquo;Not so fast, Galbraith. There&rsquo;s some mystery
      in all this. There&rsquo;s my sleep to be accounted for yet. You had some
      reason, some&rdquo;&mdash;he caught the eyes of Pierre. He paused. A light began
      to dawn on his mind, and he looked at Jen, who stood rigidly pale, her
      eyes fixed fearfully, anxiously, upon him. She too was beginning to frame
      in her mind a possible horror; the thing that had so changed her father,
      the cause for drugging the soldier. There was a silence in which Pierre
      first, and then all, detected the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs. Pierre went to
      the door and looked out. He turned round again, and shrugged his shoulders
      with an expression of helplessness. But as he saw Jen was about to speak,
      and Sergeant Tom to move towards the door, he put up his hand to stay them
      both, and said: &ldquo;A little&mdash;wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all were silent. Jen&rsquo;s fingers nervously clasped and unclasped, and
      her eyes were strained towards the door. Sergeant Tom stood watching her
      pityingly; the old man&rsquo;s head was bowed. The sound of galloping grew
      plainer. It stopped. An instant and then three horsemen appeared before
      the door. One was Inspector Jules, one was Private Waugh, and the other
      between them was&mdash;let Jen tell who he was. With an agonised cry she
      rushed from the house and threw herself against the saddle, and with her
      arms about the prisoner, cried: &ldquo;Oh, Val, Val, it was you! It was you they
      were after. It was you that&mdash;oh no, no, no! My poor Val, and I can&rsquo;t
      tell you&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great as was her grief and self-reproach, she felt it would be cruel to
      tell him the part she had taken in placing him in this position. She hated
      herself, but why deepen his misery? His face was pale, but it had its old,
      open, fearless look, which dissipation had not greatly marred. His eyelids
      quivered, but he smiled, and touching her with his steel-bound hands,
      gently said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Jen. It isn&rsquo;t so bad. You see it was this way: Snow Devil
      said something about someone that belonged to me, that cares more about me
      than I deserve. Well, he died sudden, and I was there at the time. That&rsquo;s
      all. I was trying with the help of Pretty Pierre to get out of the
      country&rdquo;&mdash;and he waved his hand towards the half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Pretty Pierre&mdash;Pierre&rdquo;? she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he isn&rsquo;t all gambler. But they were too quick for me, and here I am.
      Jules is a hustler on the march. But he said he&rsquo;d stop here and let me see
      you and dad as we go up to Fort Desire, and&mdash;there, don&rsquo;t mind, Sis&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      mind it so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sobs had ceased, but she clung to him as if she could never let him
      go. Her father stood near her, all the lines in his face deepened into
      bitterness. To him Val said: &ldquo;Why, dad, what&rsquo;s the matter? Your hand is
      shaky. Don&rsquo;t you get this thing eatin&rsquo; at your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth it. That Injin would have died if you&rsquo;d been in my place,
      I guess. Between you and me, I expect to give Jules the slip before we get
      there.&rdquo; And he laughed at the Inspector, who laughed a little austerely
      too, and in his heart wished that it was anyone else he had as a prisoner
      than Val Galbraith, who was a favourite with the Riders of the Plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Tom had been standing in the doorway regarding this scene, and
      working out in his mind the complications that had led to it. At this
      point he came forward, and Inspector Jules said to him, after a curt
      salutation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in a hurry last night, Sergeant Gellatly. You don&rsquo;t seem so
      pushed for time now. Usual thing. When a man seems over-zealous&mdash;drink,
      cards, or women behind it. But your taste is good, even if, under present
      circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;He stopped, for he saw a threatening look in the eyes
      of the other, and that other said: &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t discuss that matter,
      Inspector, if you please. I&rsquo;m going on to Fort Desire now. I couldn&rsquo;t have
      seen you if I&rsquo;d wanted to last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense. If you had waited one minute longer at the barracks you
      could have done so. I called to you as you were leaving, but you didn&rsquo;t
      turn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All were listening to this conversation, and none more curiously than
      Private Waugh. Many a time in days to come he pictured the scene for the
      benefit of his comrades. Pretty Pierre, leaning against the hitching-post
      near the bar-room, said languidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Inspector, he speaks the truth&mdash;quite: that is a virtue of the
      Riders of the Plains.&rdquo; Val had his eyes on the half-breed, and a look of
      understanding passed between them. While Val and his father and sister
      were saying their farewells in few words, but with homely demonstrations,
      Sergeant Tom brought his horse round and mounted it. Inspector Jules gave
      the word to move on. As they started, Gellatly, who fell behind the others
      slightly, leaned down and whispered: &ldquo;Forgive me, Jen. You did a noble act
      for me, and the life of me would prove to you that I&rsquo;m grateful. It&rsquo;s
      sorry, sorry I am. But I&rsquo;ll do what I can for Val, as sure as the heart&rsquo;s
      in me. Good-bye, Jen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with a faint hope in her eyes. &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      believe you... Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes there was only a cloud of dust on the prairie to tell
      where the Law and its quarry were. And of those left behind, one was a
      broken-spirited old man with sorrow melting away the sinister look in his
      face; one, a girl hovering between the tempest of bitterness and a storm
      of self-reproach; and one a half-breed gambler, who again sat on the
      bar-counter smoking a cigarette and singing to himself, as indolently as
      if he were not in the presence of a painful drama of life, perhaps a
      tragedy. But was the song so pointless to the occasion, after all, and was
      the man so abstracted and indifferent as he seemed? For thus the song ran:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, the bird in a cage and the bird on a tree
        Voila! &lsquo;tis a different fear!
     The maiden weeps and she bends the knee
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!
     But the bird in a cage has a friend in the tree,
        And the maiden she dries her tear:
     And the night is dark and no moon you see
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!
     When the doors are open the bird is free
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      These words kept ringing in Jen&rsquo;s ears as she stood again in the doorway
      that night with her face turned to the beacon. How different it seemed
      now! When she saw it last night it was a cheerful spirit of light&mdash;a
      something suggesting comfort, companionship, aspiration, a friend to the
      traveller, and a mysterious, but delightful, association. In the morning
      when she returned from that fortunate, yet most unfortunate, ride, it was
      still burning, but its warm flame was exhausted in the glow of the
      life-giving sun; the dream and delight of the night robbed of its glamour
      by the garish morning; like her own body, its task done, sinking before
      the unrelieved scrutiny of the day. To-night it burned with a different
      radiance. It came in fiery palpitations from the earth. It made a sound
      that was now like the moan of pine trees, now like the rumble of far-off
      artillery. The slight wind that blew spread the topmost crest of flame
      into strands of ruddy hair, and, looking at it, Jen saw herself rocked to
      and fro by tumultuous emotions, yet fuller of strength and larger of life
      than ever she had been. Her hot veins beat with determination, with a love
      which she drove back by another, cherished now more than it had ever been,
      because danger threatened the boy to whom she had been as a mother. In
      twenty-four hours she had grown to the full stature of love and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were shadows that betrayed less roundness to her face; there were
      lines that told of weariness; but in her eyes there was a glowing light of
      hope. She raised her face to the stars and unconsciously paraphrasing
      Pierre&rsquo;s song said: &ldquo;Oh, the God that dost save us, hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand touched her arm, and a voice said, huskily, &ldquo;Jen, I wanted to save
      him and&mdash;and not let you know of it; that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;re not keepin&rsquo; a
      grudge agin me, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not move nor turn her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no grudge, father; but&mdash;if&mdash;if
      you had told me, &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be on my mind that I had made it worse for
      Val.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kindness in the voice reassured him, and he ventured to say: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      think you&rsquo;d be carin&rsquo; for one of the Riders of the Plains, Jen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the old man trembled lest she should resent his words. She seemed
      about to do so, but the flush faded from her brow, and she said, simply:
      &ldquo;I care for Val most, father. But he didn&rsquo;t know he was getting Val into
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly quivered as a wave of emotion passed through her; and she
      said, with a sob in her voice: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all scrub country, father, and no
      paths, and&mdash;and I wish I had a mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man sat down in the doorway and bowed his grey head in his arms.
      Then, after a moment, he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been dead twenty-two years, Jen. The day Val was born she went
      away. I&rsquo;d a-been a better man if she&rsquo;d a-lived, Jen; and a better father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an unusual demonstration between these two. She watched him sadly
      for a moment, and then, leaning over and touching him gently on the
      shoulder, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse for you than it is for me, father. Don&rsquo;t feel
      so bad. Perhaps we shall save him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught a gleam of hope in her words: &ldquo;Mebbe, Jen, mebbe!&rdquo; and he raised
      his face to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ritual of affection was crude and unadorned; but it was real. They
      sat there for half-an-hour, silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a figure came out of the shadows behind the house and stood before
      them. It was Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go to-morrow morning, Galbraith,&rdquo; he said. The old man nodded, but did
      not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go to Fort Desire,&rdquo; the gambler added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jen faced him. &ldquo;What do you go there for, Pretty Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my whim. Besides, there is Val. He might want a horse some dark
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, do you mean that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as Sergeant Tom means what he says. Every man has his friends.
      Pretty Pierre has a fancy for Val Galbraith&mdash;a little. It suits him
      to go to Fort Desire. Jen Galbraith, you make a grand ride last night. You
      do a bold thing&mdash;all for a man. We shall see what he will do for you.
      And if he does nothing&mdash;ah! you can trust the tongue of Pretty
      Pierre. He will wish he could die, instead of&mdash;Eh, bien, good-night!&rdquo;
       He moved away. Jen followed him. She held out her hand. It was the first
      time she had ever done so to this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I believe that you mean well to our Val. I am
      sorry that I called you a devil.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle, that is nothing.
      You spoke true. But devils have their friends&mdash;and their whims. So
      you see, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe it will come out all right, Jen&mdash;mebbe!&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jen did not reply. She was thinking hard, her eyes upon the Prairie
      Star. Living life to the hilt greatly illumines the outlook of the mind.
      She was beginning to understand that evil is not absolute, and that good
      is often an occasion more than a condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence again. At last the old man rose to go and reduce
      the volume of flame for the night; but Jen stopped him. &ldquo;No, father, let
      it burn all it can to-night. It&rsquo;s comforting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe so&mdash;mebbe!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint refrain came to them from within the house:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;When doors are open the bird is free
        Oh, the sweet Saint Gabrielle hear!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely morning. The prairie billowed away endlessly to the south,
      and heaved away in vastness to the north; and the fresh, sharp air sent
      the blood beating through the veins. In the bar-room some early traveller
      was talking to Peter Galbraith. A wandering band of Indians was camped
      about a mile away, the only sign of humanity in the waste. Jen sat in the
      doorway culling dried apples. Though tragedies occur in lives of the
      humble, they must still do the dull and ordinary task. They cannot stop to
      cherish morbidness, to feed upon their sorrow; they must care for
      themselves and labour for others. And well is it for them that it is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian camp brings unpleasant memories to Jen&rsquo;s mind. She knows it
      belongs to old Sun-in-the-North, and that he will not come to see her now,
      nor could she, or would she, go to him. Between her and that race there
      can never again be kindly communion. And now she sees, for the first time,
      two horsemen riding slowly in the track from Fort Desire towards
      Galbraith&rsquo;s Place. She notices that one sits upright, and one seems
      leaning forward on his horse&rsquo;s neck. She shades her eyes with her hand,
      but she cannot distinguish who they are. But she has seen men tied to
      their horses ride as that man is riding, when stricken with fever, bruised
      by falling timber, lacerated by a grizzly, wounded by a bullet, or crushed
      by a herd of buffaloes. She remembered at that moment the time that a
      horse had struck Val with its forefeet, and torn the flesh from his chest,
      and how he had been brought home tied to a broncho&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of this drove her into the house, to have Val&rsquo;s bed prepared
      for the sufferer, whoever he was. Almost unconsciously she put on the
      little table beside the bed a bunch of everlasting prairie flowers, and
      shaded the light to the point of quiet and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went outside again. The travellers now were not far away. She
      recognised the upright rider. It was Pretty Pierre. The other&mdash;she
      could not tell. She called to her father. She had a fear which she did not
      care to face alone. &ldquo;See, see, father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Pretty Pierre and&mdash;and
      can it be Val?&rdquo; For the moment she seemed unable to stir. But the old man
      shook his head, and said: &ldquo;No, Jen, it can&rsquo;t be. It ain&rsquo;t Val.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then another thought possessed her. Her lips trembled, and, throwing her
      head back as does a deer when it starts to shake off its pursuers by
      flight, she ran swiftly towards the riders. The traveller standing beside
      Galbraith said: &ldquo;That man is hurt, wounded probably. I didn&rsquo;t expect to
      have a patient in the middle of the plains. I&rsquo;m a doctor. Perhaps I can be
      of use here?&rdquo; When a hundred yards away Jen recognised the recumbent
      rider. A thousand thoughts flashed through her brain. What had happened?
      Why was he dressed in civilian&rsquo;s clothes? A moment, and she was at his
      horse&rsquo;s head. Another, and her warm hand clasped the pale, moist, and
      wrinkled one which hung by the horse&rsquo;s neck. His coat at the shoulder was
      stained with blood, and there was a handkerchief about his head. This&mdash;this
      was Sergeant Tom Gellatly!
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at Pierre, an agony of inquiry in her eyes, and pointing
      mutely to the wounded man. Pierre spoke with a tone of seriousness not
      common to his voice: &ldquo;You see, Jen Galbraith, it was brave. Sergeant Tom
      one day resigns the Mounted Police. He leaves the Riders of the Plains.
      That is not easy to understand, for he is in much favour with the
      officers. But he buys himself out, and there is the end of the Sergeant
      and his triple chevron. That is one day. That night, two men on a ferry
      are crossing the Saskatchewan at Fort Desire. They are fired at from the
      shore behind. One man is hit twice. But they get across, cut the ferry
      loose, mount horses, and ride away together. The man that was hit&mdash;yes,
      Sergeant Tom. The other that was not hit was Val Galbraith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jen gave a cry of mingled joy and pain, and said, with Tom Gellatly&rsquo;s cold
      hand clasped to her bosom: &ldquo;Val, our Val, is free, is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Val is free and safe-quite. The Riders of the Plains could not cross
      the river. It was too high. And so Tom Gellatly and Val got away. Val
      rides straight for the American border, and the other rides here.&rdquo; They
      were now near the house, but Jen said, eagerly: &ldquo;Go on. Tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew what had happened soon, and I rode away, too, and last night I
      found Tom Gellatly lying beside his horse on the prairie. I have brought
      him here to you. You two are even now, Jen Galbraith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the tavern door. The traveller and Pierre lifted, down the
      wounded and unconscious man, and brought him and laid him on Val
      Galbraith&rsquo;s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller examined the wounds in the shoulder and the head, and said:
      &ldquo;The head is all right. If I can get the bullet out of the shoulder he&rsquo;ll
      be safe enough&mdash;in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surgery was skilful but rude, for proper instruments were not at hand;
      and in a few hours he, whom we shall still call Sergeant Tom, lay quietly
      sleeping, the pallor gone from his face and the feeling of death from his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near midnight when he waked. Jen was sitting beside him. He looked
      round and saw her. Her face was touched with the light that shone from the
      Prairie Star. &ldquo;Jen,&rdquo; he said, and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the window and stood beside his bed. She took his
      outstretched hand. &ldquo;You are better, Sergeant Tom&rdquo;? she said, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m better; but it&rsquo;s not Sergeant Tom I am any longer, Jen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owed you a great debt, Jen. I couldn&rsquo;t remain one of the Riders of the
      Plains and try to pay it. I left them. Then I tried to save Val, and I
      did. I knew how to do it without getting anyone else into trouble. It is
      well to know the trick of a lock and the hour that guard is changed. I had
      left, but I relieved guard that night just the same. It was a new man on
      watch. It&rsquo;s only a minute I had; for the regular relief watch was almost
      at my heels. I got Val out just in time. They discovered us, and we had a
      run for it. Pretty Pierre has told you. That&rsquo;s right. Val is safe now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a low strained voice, interrupting him, she said, &ldquo;Did Val leave you
      wounded so on the prairie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that ate at your heart. No, he didn&rsquo;t. I hurried him off, and
      he didn&rsquo;t know how bad I was hit. But I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve paid my debt, haven&rsquo;t
      I, Jen?&rdquo; With eyes that could not see for tears, she touched pityingly,
      lovingly, the wounds on his head and shoulder, and said: &ldquo;These pay a
      greater debt than you ever owed me. You risked your life for me&mdash;yes,
      for me. You have given up everything to do it. I can&rsquo;t pay you the great
      difference. No, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, you can, if you will, Jen. It&rsquo;s as aisy! If you&rsquo;ll say
      what I say, I&rsquo;ll give you quit of that difference, as you call it, forever
      and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, tell me. Is Val quite, quite safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s safe over the border by this time; and to tell you the truth,
      the Riders of the Plains wouldn&rsquo;t be dyin&rsquo; to arrest him again if he was
      in Canada, which he isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s little they wanted to fire at us, I know,
      when we were crossin&rsquo; the river, but it had to be done, you see, and us
      within sight. Will you say what I ask you, Jen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak, but pressed his hand ever so slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Gellatly, I promise,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Gellatly, I promise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give you as much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give you as much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and then she falteringly said, &ldquo;Love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you give to me-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you give to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take you poor as you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take you poor as you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be my husband as long as you live&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be my husband as long as you live&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me, God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me, God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stooped with dropping tears, and he kissed her once. Then what was
      girl in her timidly drew back, while what was woman in her, and therefore
      maternal, yearned over the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not seen the figure of an old man at the door. They did not hear
      him enter. They only knew of Peter Galbraith&rsquo;s presence when he said:
      &ldquo;Mebbe&mdash;mebbe I might say Amen!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THREE OUTLAWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The missionary at Fort Anne of the H. B. C. was violently in earnest.
      Before he piously followed the latest and most amply endowed batch of
      settlers, who had in turn preceded the new railway to the Fort, the word
      scandal had no place in the vocabulary of the citizens. The H. B. C. had
      never imported it into the Chinook language, the common meeting-ground of
      all the tribes of the North; and the British men and native-born, who made
      the Fort their home, or place of sojourn, had never found need for its
      use. Justice was so quickly distributed, men were so open in their
      conduct, good and bad, that none looked askance, nor put their actions in
      ambush, nor studied innuendo. But this was not according to the new
      dispensation&mdash;that is, the dispensation which shrewdly followed the
      settlers, who as shrewdly preceded the railway. And, the dispensation and
      the missionary were known also as the Reverend Ezra Badgley, who, on his
      own declaration, in times past had &ldquo;a call&rdquo; to preach, and in the far East
      had served as local preacher, then probationer, then went on circuit, and
      now was missionary in a district of which the choice did credit to his
      astuteness, and gave room for his piety and for his holy rage against the
      Philistines. He loved a word for righteous mouthing, and in a moment of
      inspiration pagan and scandal came to him. Upon these two words he
      stamped, through them he perspired mightily, and with them he clenched his
      stubby fingers&mdash;such fingers as dug trenches, or snatched lewdly at
      soft flesh, in days of barbarian battle. To him all men were Pagans who
      loved not the sound of his voice, nor wrestled with him in prayer before
      the Lord, nor fed him with rich food, nor gave him much strong green tea
      to drink. But these men were of opaque stuff, and were not dismayed, and
      they called him St. Anthony, and with a prophetic and deadly patience
      waited. The time came when the missionary shook his denouncing finger
      mostly at Pretty Pierre, who carefully nursed his silent wrath until the
      occasion should arrive for a delicate revenge which hath its hour with
      every man, if, hating, he knows how to bide the will of Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour came. A girl had been found dying on the roadside beyond the Fort
      by the drunken doctor of the place and Pierre. Pierre was with her when
      she died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s to bury her, the poor colleen&rdquo;? said Shon McGann afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre musingly replied: &ldquo;She is a Protestant. There is but one man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After many pertinent and vigorous remarks, Shon added, &ldquo;A Pagan is it, he
      calls you, Pierre, you that&rsquo;s had the holy water on y&rsquo;r forehead, and the
      cross on the water, and that knows the book o&rsquo; the Mass like the cards in
      a pack? Sinner y&rsquo; are, and so are we all, God save us! say I; and weavin&rsquo; 
      the stripes for our backs He may be, and little I&rsquo;d think of Him failin&rsquo; 
      in that: but Pagan&mdash;faith, it&rsquo;s black should be the white of the eyes
      of that preachin&rsquo; sneak, and a rattle of teeth in his throat&mdash;divils
      go round me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed, still musing, replied: &ldquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for
      a tooth&mdash;is that it, Shon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nivir a word truer by song or by book,
      and stand by the text, say I. For Papist I am, and Papist are you; and the
      imps from below in y&rsquo;r fingers whip poker is the game; and outlaws as they
      call us both&mdash;you for what it doesn&rsquo;t concern me, and I for a wild
      night in ould Donegal&mdash;but Pagan, wurra! whin shall it be, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall it to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True for you. The teeth in his throat and a lump to his eye, and what
      more be the will o&rsquo; God. Fightin&rsquo; there&rsquo;ll be, av coorse; but by you I&rsquo;ll
      stand, and sorra inch will I give, if they&rsquo;ll do it with sticks or with
      guns, and not with the blisterin&rsquo; tongue that&rsquo;s lied of me and me frinds&mdash;for
      frind I call you, Pierre, that loved me little in days gone by. And proud
      I am not of you, nor you of me; but we&rsquo;ve tasted the bitter of avil days
      together, and divils surround me, if I don&rsquo;t go down with you or come up
      with you, whichever it be! For there&rsquo;s dirt, as I say on their tongues,
      and over their shoulder they look at you, and not with an eye full front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was cool, even pensive. His lips parted slightly once or twice, and
      showed a row of white, malicious teeth. For the rest, he looked as if he
      were politely interested but not moved by the excitement of the other. He
      slowly rolled a cigarette and replied: &ldquo;He says it is a scandal that I
      live at Fort Anne. Well, I was here before he came, and I shall be here
      after he goes&mdash;yes. A scandal&mdash;tsh! what is that? You know the
      word &lsquo;Raca&rsquo; of the Book? Well, there shall be more &lsquo;Raca; soon&mdash;perhaps.
      No, there shall not be fighting as you think, Shon; but&mdash;&rdquo; here
      Pierre rose, came over, and spread his fingers lightly on Shon&rsquo;s breast
      &ldquo;but this thing is between this man and me, Shon McGann, and you shall see
      a great matter. Perhaps there will be blood, perhaps not&mdash;perhaps
      only an end.&rdquo; And the half-breed looked up at the Irishman from under his
      dark brows so covertly and meaningly that Shon saw visions of a trouble as
      silent as a plague, as resistless as a great flood. This noiseless
      vengeance was not after his own heart. He almost shivered as the delicate
      fingers drummed on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angels begird me, Pretty Pierre, but it&rsquo;s little I&rsquo;d like you for enemy
      o&rsquo; mine; for I know that you&rsquo;d wait for y&rsquo;r foe with death in y&rsquo;r hand,
      and pity far from y&rsquo;r heart; and y&rsquo;d smile as you pulled the black-cap on
      y&rsquo;r head, and laugh as you drew the life out of him, God knows how! Arrah,
      give me, sez I, the crack of a stick, the bite of a gun, or the clip of a
      sabre&rsquo;s edge, with a shout in y&rsquo;r mouth the while!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Pierre still listened lazily, there was a wicked fire in his eyes.
      His words now came from his teeth with cutting precision. &ldquo;I have a great
      thought tonight, Shon McGann. I will tell you when we meet again. But, my
      friend, one must not be too rash&mdash;no, not too brutal. Even the sabre
      should fall at the right time, and then swift and still. Noise is not
      battle. Well, &lsquo;au revoir!&rsquo; To-morrow I shall tell you many things.&rdquo; He
      caught Shon&rsquo;s hand quickly, as quickly dropped it, and went out indolently
      singing a favourite song,&mdash;&ldquo;Voici le sabre de mon Pere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dark. Pretty Pierre stood still, and thought for a while. At last
      he spoke aloud: &ldquo;Well, I shall do it, now I have him&mdash;so!&rdquo; And he
      opened and shut his hand swiftly and firmly. He moved on, avoiding the
      more habited parts of the place, and by a roundabout came to a house
      standing very close to the bank of the river. He went softly to the door
      and listened. Light shone through the curtain of a window. He went to the
      window and looked beneath the curtain. Then he came back to the door,
      opened it very gently, stepped inside, and closed it behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man seated at a table, eating, rose; a man on whom greed had set its
      mark&mdash;greed of the flesh, greed of men&rsquo;s praise, greed of money. His
      frame was thick-set, his body was heavily nourished, his eye was shifty
      but intelligent; and a close observer would have seen something elusive,
      something furtive and sinister, in his face. His lips were greasy with
      meat as he stood up, and a fear sprang to his face, so that its fat looked
      sickly. But he said hoarsely, and with an attempt at being brave&mdash;&ldquo;How
      dare you enter my house with out knocking? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed waved a hand protestingly towards him. &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Be seated, and finish your meal. Do you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I said, do not stop your meal. I have come to speak with you
      very quietly about a scandal&mdash;a scandal, you understand. This is
      Sunday night, a good time to talk of such things.&rdquo; Pierre seated himself
      at the table, opposite the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man replied: &ldquo;I have nothing to say to you. You are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed interrupted: &ldquo;Yes, I know, a Pagan fattening&mdash;&rdquo; here
      he smiled, and looked at his thin hands&mdash;&ldquo;fattening for the shambles
      of the damned, as you have said from the pulpit, Reverend Ezra Badgley.
      But you will permit me&mdash;a sinner as you say&mdash;to speak to you
      like this while you sit down and eat. I regret to disturb you, but you
      will sit, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre&rsquo;s tone was smooth and low, almost deferential, and his eyes, wide
      open now, and hot with some hidden purpose, were fixed compellingly on the
      man. The missionary sat, and, having recovered slightly, fumbled with a
      knife and fork. A napkin was still beneath his greasy chin. He did not
      take it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre then spoke slowly: &ldquo;Yes, it is a scandal concerning a sinner&mdash;and
      a Pagan.... Will you permit me to light a cigarette? Thank you.... You
      have said many harsh things about me: well, as you see, I am amiable. I
      lived at Fort Anne before you came. They call me Pretty Pierre. Why is my
      cheek so? Because I drink no wine; I eat not much. Pardon, pork like that
      on your plate&mdash;no! no! I do not take green tea as there in your cup;
      I do not love women, one or many. Again, pardon, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other drew his brows together with an attempt at pious frowning and
      indignation; but there was a cold, sneering smile now turned upon him, and
      it changed the frown to anxiety, and made his lips twitch, and the food he
      had eaten grow heavy within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to the scandal slowly. The woman? She was a young girl travelling
      from the far East, to search for a man who had&mdash;spoiled her. She was
      found by me and another. Ah, you start so!... Will you not listen?...
      Well, she died to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the missionary gasped, and caught with both hands at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before she died she gave two things into my hands: a packet of
      letters&mdash;a man is a fool to write such letters&mdash;and a small
      bottle of poison&mdash;laudanum, old-fashioned but sure. The letters were
      from the man at Fort Anne&mdash;the man, you hear! The other was for her
      death, if he would not take her to his arms again. Women are mad when they
      love. And so she came to Fort Anne, but not in time. The scandal is great,
      because the man is holy&mdash;sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed said the last two words sharply, but not loudly. They both
      sat down slowly again, looking each other in the eyes. Then Pierre drew
      from his pocket a small bottle and a packet of letters, and held them
      before him. &ldquo;I have this to say: there are citizens of Fort Anne who stand
      for justice more than law; who have no love for the ways of St. Anthony.
      There is a Pagan, too, an outlaw, who knows when it is time to give blow
      for blow with the holy man. Well, we understand each other, &lsquo;hein?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elusive, sinister look in the missionary&rsquo;s face was etched in strong
      lines now. A dogged sullenness hung about his lips. He noticed that one
      hand only of Pretty Pierre was occupied with the relics of the dead girl;
      the other was free to act suddenly on a hip pocket. &ldquo;What do you want me
      to do&rdquo;? he said, not whiningly, for beneath the selfish flesh and shallow
      outworks there were the elements of a warrior&mdash;all pulpy now, but
      they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; was the reply: &ldquo;for you to make one more outlaw at Fort Anne by
      drinking what is in this bottle&mdash;sit down, quick, by God!&rdquo; He placed
      the bottle within reach of the other. &ldquo;Then you shall have these letters;
      and there is the fire. After? Well, you will have a great sleep, the good
      people will find you, they will bury you, weeping much, and no one knows
      here but me. Refuse that, and there is the other, the Law&mdash;ah, the
      poor girl was so very young!&mdash;and the wild Justice which is sometimes
      quicker than Law. Well? well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The missionary sat as if paralysed, his face all grey, his eyes fixed on
      the half-breed. &ldquo;Are you man or devil&rdquo;? he groaned at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a slight, fantastic gesture Pierre replied: &ldquo;It was said that a devil
      entered into me at birth, but that was mere scandal&mdash;&lsquo;peut-etre.&rsquo; You
      shall think as you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. The sullenness about the missionary&rsquo;s lips became
      charged with a contempt more animal than human. The Reverend Ezra Badgley
      knew that the man before him was absolute in his determination, and that
      the Pagans of Fort Anne would show him little mercy, while his flock would
      leave him to his fate. He looked at the bottle. The silence grew, so that
      the ticking of the watch in the missionary&rsquo;s pocket could be heard
      plainly, having for its background of sound the continuous swish of the
      river. Pretty Pierre&rsquo;s eyes were never taken off the other, whose gaze,
      again, was fixed upon the bottle with a terrible fascination. An hour, two
      hours, passed. The fire burned lower. It was midnight; and now the watch
      no longer ticked; it had fulfilled its day&rsquo;s work. The missionary
      shuddered slightly at this. He looked up to see the resolute gloom of the
      half-breed&rsquo;s eyes, and that sneering smile, fixed upon him still. Then he
      turned once more to the bottle.... His heavy hand moved slowly towards it.
      His stubby fingers perspired and showed sickly in the light.... They
      closed about the bottle. Then suddenly he raised it, and drained it at a
      draught. He sighed once heavily and as if a great inward pain was over.
      Rising he took the letters silently pushed towards him, and dropped them
      into the fire. He went to the window, raised it, and threw the bottle into
      the river. The cork was left: Pierre pointed to it. He took it up with a
      strange smile and thrust it into the coals. Then he sat down by the table,
      leaning his arms upon it, his eyes staring painfully before him, and the
      forgotten napkin still about his neck. Soon the eyes closed, and, with a
      moan on his lips, his head dropped forward on his arms.... Pierre rose,
      and, looking at the figure soon to be breathless as the baked meats about
      it, said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; he was not all coward. No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned and went out into the night.

    <h2>
      SHON McGANN&rsquo;S TOBOGAN RIDE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s down the long side of Farcalladen Rise,
        With the knees pressing hard to the saddle, my men;
     With the sparks from the hoofs giving light to the eyes,
        And our hearts beating hard as we rode to the glen!

     &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s back with the ring of the chain and the spur,
        And it&rsquo;s back with the sun on the hill and the moor,
     And it&rsquo;s back is the thought sets my pulses astir!
        But I&rsquo;ll never go back to Farcalladen more.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shon McGann was lying on a pile of buffalo robes in a mountain hut,&mdash;an
      Australian would call it a humpey,&mdash;singing thus to himself with his
      pipe between his teeth. In the room, besides Shon, were Pretty Pierre, Jo
      Gordineer, the Hon. Just Trafford, called by his companions simply &ldquo;The
      Honourable,&rdquo; and Prince Levis, the owner of the establishment. Not that
      Monsieur Levis, the French Canadian, was really a Prince. The name was
      given to him with a humorous cynicism peculiar to the Rockies. We have
      little to do with Prince Levis here; but since he may appear elsewhere,
      this explanation is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo Gordineer had been telling The Honourable about the ghost of Guidon
      Mountain, and Pretty Pierre was collaborating with their host in the
      preparation of what, in the presence of the Law&mdash;that is of the
      North-West Mounted Police&mdash;was called ginger-tea, in consideration of
      the prohibition statute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon McGann had been left to himself&mdash;an unusual thing; for everyone
      had a shot at Shon when opportunity occurred; and never a bull&rsquo;s-eye could
      they make on him. His wit was like the shield of a certain personage of
      mythology.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had wandered on from verse to verse of the song with one eye on the
      collaborators and an ear open to The Honourable&rsquo;s polite exclamations of
      wonder. Jo had, however, come to the end of his weird tale&mdash;for weird
      it certainly was, told at the foot of Guidon Mountain itself, and in a
      region of vast solitudes&mdash;the pair of chemists were approaching &ldquo;the
      supreme union of unctuous elements,&rdquo; as The Honourable put it, and in the
      silence that fell for a moment there crept the words of the singer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s down the long side of Farcalladen Rise,
        And it&rsquo;s swift as an arrow and straight as a spear&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Jo Gordineer interrupted. &ldquo;Say, Shon, when&rsquo;ll you be through that tobogan
      ride of yours? Aint there any end to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Shon was looking with both eyes now at the collaborators, and he sang
      softly on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s keen as the frost when the summer-time dies,
        That we rode to the glen and with never a fear.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he added: &ldquo;The end&rsquo;s cut off, Joey, me boy; but what&rsquo;s a tobogan
      ride, annyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to that, Pierre. I&rsquo;ll be eternally shivered if he knows what a
      tobogan ride is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot shivers it&rsquo;ll be for you, Joey, me boy, and no quinine over the bar
      aither,&rdquo; said Shon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him what a tobogan ride is, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pretty Pierre said: &ldquo;Eh, well, I will tell you. It is like-no, you
      have the word precise, Joseph. Eh? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre then added something in French. Shon did not understand it, but he
      saw The Honourable smile, so with a gentle kind of contempt he went on
      singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s hey for the hedge, and it&rsquo;s hey for the wall!
        And it&rsquo;s over the stream with an echoing cry;
     And there&rsquo;s three fled for ever from old Donegal,
        And there&rsquo;s two that have shown how bold Irishmen die.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Honourable then said, &ldquo;What is that all about, Shon? I never heard the
      song before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more you did. And I wish I could see the lad that wrote that song,
      livin&rsquo; or dead. If one of ye&rsquo;s will tell me about your tobogan rides, I&rsquo;ll
      unfold about Farcalladen Rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Levis passed the liquor. Pretty Pierre, seated on a candle-box,
      with a glass in his delicate fingers, said: &ldquo;Eh, well, the Honourable has
      much language. He can speak, precise&mdash;this would be better with a
      little lemon, just a little,&mdash;the Honourable, he, perhaps, will tell.
      Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre was showing his white teeth. At this stage in his career, he
      did not love the Honourable. The Honourable understood that, but he made
      clear to Shon&rsquo;s mind what toboganing is.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shon, on his part, with fresh and hearty voice, touched here and there
      by a plaintive modulation, told about that ride on Farcalladen Rise; a
      tale of broken laws, and fight and fighting, and death and exile; and
      never a word of hatred in it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the writer of the song, who was he&rdquo;? asked the Honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman after God&rsquo;s own heart. Heaven rest his soul, if he&rsquo;s dead,
      which I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; is so, and give him the luck of the world if he&rsquo;s
      livin&rsquo;, say I. But it&rsquo;s little I know what&rsquo;s come to him. In the heart of
      Australia I saw him last; and mates we were together after gold. And
      little gold did we get but what was in the heart of him. And we parted one
      day, I carryin&rsquo; the song that he wrote for me of Farcalladen Rise, and the
      memory of him; and him givin&rsquo; me the word,&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget you, Shon, me
      boy, whatever comes; remember that. And a short pull of the Three-Star
      together for the partin&rsquo; salute,&rsquo; says he. And the Three-Star in one sup
      each we took, as solemn as the Mass, and he went away towards Cloncurry
      and I to the coast; and that&rsquo;s the last that I saw of him, now three years
      gone. And here I am, and I wish I was with him wherever he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name&rdquo;? said the Honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fingers of the Honourable trembled on his cigar. &ldquo;Very interesting,
      Shon,&rdquo; he said, as he rose, puffing hard till his face was in a cloud of
      smoke. &ldquo;You had many adventures together, I suppose,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adventures we had and sufferin&rsquo; bewhiles, and fun, too, to the neck and
      flowin&rsquo; over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spin us a long yarn about them another night, Shon&rdquo;? said the
      Honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it now&mdash;a yarn as long as the lies of the Government; and
      proud of the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, Shon&rdquo; (there was a kind of huskiness in the voice of the
      Honourable); &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to turn in. We&rsquo;ve a long tramp over the glacier
      to-morrow, and we must start at sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable was in command of the party, though Jo Gordineer was the
      guide, and all were, for the moment, miners, making for the little Goshen
      Field over in Pipi Valley.&mdash;At least Pretty Pierre said he was a
      miner.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one thought of disputing the authority of the Honourable, and they all
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes there was silence in the hut, save for the oracular
      breathing of Prince Levis and the sparks from the fire. But the Honourable
      did not sleep well; he lay and watched the fire through most of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was clear, glowing, decisive. Not a cloud in the curve of azure,
      not a shiver of wind down the canon, not a frown in Nature, if we except
      the lowering shadows from the shoulders of the giants of the range.
      Crowning the shadows was a splendid helmet of light, rich with the dyes of
      the morning; the pines were touched with a brilliant if austere warmth.
      The pride of lofty lineage and severe isolation was regnant over all. And
      up through the splendour, and the shadows, and the loneliness, and the
      austere warmth, must our travellers go. Must go? Scarcely that, but the
      Honourable had made up his mind to cross the glacier and none sought to
      dissuade him from his choice; the more so, because there was something of
      danger in the business. Pretty Pierre had merely shrugged his shoulders at
      the suggestion, and had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nom de Dieu,&rsquo; the higher we go the faster we live, that is something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes we live ourselves to death too quickly. In my schooldays I
      watched a mouse in a jar of oxygen do that;&rdquo; said the Honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the best way to die,&rdquo; remarked the halfbreed&mdash;&ldquo;much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jo Gordineer had been over the path before. He was confident of the way,
      and proud of his office of guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb Mont Blanc, if you will,&rdquo; said the Honourable, &ldquo;but leave me these
      white bastions of the Selkirks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even so. They have not seen the snowy hills of God who have yet to look
      upon the Rocky Mountains, absolute, stupendous, sublimely grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo Gordineer and Pretty Pierre strode on together. They being well away
      from the other two, the Honourable turned and said to Shon: &ldquo;What was the
      name of the man who wrote that song of yours, again, Shon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but his first name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duke&mdash;Duke Lawless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, in which the other seemed to be intently studying the
      glacier above them. Then he said: &ldquo;What was he like?&mdash;in appearance,
      I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trifle more than your six feet, about your colour of hair and eyes, and
      with a trick of smilin&rsquo; that would melt the heart of an exciseman, and
      O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s own at a joke, barrin&rsquo; a time or two that he got hold of a
      pile of papers from the ould country. By the grave of St. Shon! thin he
      was as dry of fun as a piece of blotting paper. And he said at last,
      before he was aisy and free again, &lsquo;Shon,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s better to burn
      your ships behind ye, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, havin&rsquo; thought of a glen in ould Ireland that I&rsquo;ll never see
      again, nor any that&rsquo;s in it, said: &lsquo;Not, only burn them to the water&rsquo;s
      edge, Duke Lawless, but swear to your own soul that they never lived but
      in the dreams of the night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Shon,&rsquo; says he, and after that no luck was bad
      enough to cloud the gay heart of him, and bad enough it was sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you fear that he is not alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I met an old mate of mine one day on the Frazer, and he said that
      Lawless had never come to Cloncurry; and a hard, hard road it was to
      travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jo Gordineer was calling to them, and there the conversation ended. In a
      few minutes the four stood on the edge of the glacier. Each man had a long
      hickory stick which served as alpenstock, a bag hung at his side, and tied
      to his back was his gold-pan, the hollow side in, of course. Shon&rsquo;s was
      tied a little lower down than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed up this solid river of ice, this giant power at endless strife
      with the high hills, up towards its head. The Honourable was the first to
      reach the point of vantage, and to look down upon the vast and wandering
      fissures, the frigid bulwarks, the great fortresses of ice, the ceaseless
      snows, the aisles of this mountain sanctuary through which Nature&rsquo;s
      splendid anthems rolled. Shon was a short distance below, with his hand
      over his eyes, sweeping the semi-circle of glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a sharp cry from Pierre: &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon McGann had fallen on a smooth pavement of ice. The gold-pan was
      beneath him, and down the glacier he was whirled-whirled, for Shon had
      thrust his heels in the snow and ice, and the gold-pan performed a series
      of circles as it sped down the incline. His fingers clutched the ice and
      snow, but they only left a red mark of blood behind. Must he go the whole
      course of that frozen slide, plump into the wild depths below?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mon Dieu!&mdash;mon Dieu!&rsquo;&rdquo; said Pretty Pierre, piteously. The face of
      the Honourable was set and tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo Gordineer&rsquo;s hand clutched his throat as if he choked. Still Shon sped.
      It was a matter of seconds only. The tragedy crowded to the awful end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tilt in the glacier, and the gold-pan, suddenly swirling,
      again swung to the outer edge, and shot over.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if hurled from a catapult, the Irishman was ejected from the white
      monster&rsquo;s back. He fell on a wide shelf of ice, covered with light snow,
      through which he was tunnelled, and dropped on another ledge below, near
      the path by which he and his companions had ascended. &ldquo;Shied from the
      finish, by God!&rdquo; said Jo Gordineer. &ldquo;&lsquo;Le pauvre Shon!&rsquo;&rdquo; added Pretty
      Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable was making his way down, his brain haunted by the words,
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never go back to Farcalladen more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jo was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Shon McGann was alive. He lay breathless, helpless, for a moment; then
      he sat up and scanned his lacerated fingers: he looked up the path by
      which he had come; he looked down the path he seemed destined to go; he
      started to scratch his head, but paused in the act, by reason of his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my mother wouldn&rsquo;t know me from a can of cold meat if
      I hadn&rsquo;t stopped at this station; but wurrawurra, what a car it was to
      come in!&rdquo; He examined his tattered clothes and bare elbows; then he
      unbuckled the gold-pan, and no easy task was it with his ragged fingers.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas not for deep minin&rsquo; I brought ye,&rdquo; he said to the pan, &ldquo;nor for
      scrapin&rsquo; the clothes from me back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the Honourable came up. &ldquo;Shon, my man... alive, thank God! How
      is it with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hardly worth the lookin&rsquo; at. I wouldn&rsquo;t turn my back to ye for a
      ransom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough that you&rsquo;re here at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, &lsquo;voila!&rsquo; this Irishman!&rdquo; said Pretty Pierre, as his light fingers
      touched Shon&rsquo;s bruised arm gently. This from Pretty Pierre!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that in the voice which went to Shon&rsquo;s heart. Who could have
      guessed that this outlaw of the North would ever show a sign of sympathy
      or friendship for anybody? But it goes to prove that you can never be
      exact in your estimate of character. Jo Gordineer only said jestingly:
      &ldquo;Say, now, what are you doing, Shon, bringing us down here, when we might
      be well into the Valley by this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That in your face and the hair aff your head,&rdquo; said Shon; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s little
      you know a tobogan ride when you see one. I&rsquo;ll take my share of the grog,
      by the same token.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable uncorked his flask. Shon threw back his head with a laugh.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s rest when the gallop is over, me men!
     And it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s to the lads that have ridden their last;
     And it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But Shon had fainted with the flask in his hand and this snatch of a song
      on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached shelter that night. Had it not been for the accident, they
      would have got to their destination in the Valley; but here they were
      twelve miles from it. Whether this was fortunate or unfortunate may be
      seen later. Comfortably bestowed in this mountain tavern, after they had
      toasted and eaten their venison and lit their pipes, they drew about the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the four, there was a figure that lay sleeping in a corner on a
      pile of pine branches, wrapped in a bearskin robe. Whoever it was slept
      soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was it like&mdash;the gold-pan flyer&mdash;the tobogan ride,
      Shon?&rdquo; remarked Jo Gordineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it like?&mdash;what was it like&rdquo;? replied Shon. &ldquo;Sure, I
      couldn&rsquo;t see what it was like for the stars that were hittin&rsquo; me in the
      eyes. There wasn&rsquo;t any world at all. I was ridin&rsquo; on a streak of
      lightnin&rsquo;, and nivir a rubber for the wheels; and my fingers makin&rsquo; 
      stripes of blood on the snow; and now the stars that were hittin&rsquo; me were
      white, and thin they were red, and sometimes blue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Stars and Stripes,&rdquo; inconsiderately remarked Jo Gordineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there wasn&rsquo;t any beginning to things, nor any end of them; and whin I
      struck the snow and cut down the core of it like a cat through a glass, I
      was willin&rsquo; to say with the Prophet of Ireland&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to pass the liniment, Pretty Pierre?&rdquo; It was Jo Gordineer
      said that.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the Prophet of Israel did say&mdash;Israel and Ireland were identical
      to Shon&mdash;was never told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon&rsquo;s bubbling sarcasm was full-stopped by the beneficent savour that,
      rising now from the hands of the four, silenced all irrelevant speech. It
      was a function of importance. It was not simply necessary to say How! or
      Here&rsquo;s reformation! or I look towards you! As if by a common instinct, the
      Honourable, Jo Gordineer, and Pretty Pierre, turned towards Shon and
      lifted their glasses. Jo Gordineer was going to say: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a safe foot
      in the stirrups to you,&rdquo; but he changed his mind and drank in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon&rsquo;s eye had been blazing with fun, but it took on, all at once, a misty
      twinkle. None of them had quite bargained for this. The feeling had come
      like a wave of soft lightning, and had passed through them. Did it come
      from the Irishman himself? Was it his own nature acting through those who
      called him &ldquo;partner&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre got up and kicked savagely at the wood in the big fireplace.
      He ostentatiously and needlessly put another log of Norfolk-pine upon the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable gaily suggested a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing us &lsquo;Avec les Braves Sauvages,&rsquo; Pierre,&rdquo; said Jo Gordineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pierre waved his fingers towards Shon: &ldquo;Shon, his song&mdash;he did
      not finish&mdash;on the glacier. It is good we hear all. &lsquo;Hein?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Shon sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s down the long side of Farcalladen Rise.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The sleeper on the pine branches stirred nervously, as if the song were
      coming through a dream to him. At the third verse he started up, and an
      eager, sun-burned face peered from the half-darkness at the singer. The
      Honourable was sitting in the shadow, with his back to the new actor in
      the scene.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s rest when the gallop is over, my men I
     And it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s to the lads that have ridden their last!
     And it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shon paused. One of those strange lapses of memory came to him which come
      at times to most of us concerning familiar things. He could get no further
      than he did on the mountain side. He passed his hand over his forehead,
      stupidly:&mdash;&ldquo;Saints forgive me; but it&rsquo;s gone from me, and sorra the
      one can I get it; me that had it by heart, and the lad that wrote it far
      away. Death in the world, but I&rsquo;ll try it again!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s rest when the gallop is over, my men!
     And it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s to the lads that have ridden their last!
     And it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from the half-darkness there came a voice, a clear baritone:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s to the lasses we leave in the glen,
     With a smile for the future, a sigh for the past.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the last words the figure strode down into the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shon, old friend, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon had started to his feet at the first note of the voice, and stood as
      if spellbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no shaking of hands. Both men held each other hard by the
      shoulders, and stood so for a moment looking steadily eye to eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Shon said: &ldquo;Duke Lawless, there&rsquo;s parallels of latitude and parallels
      of longitude, but who knows the tomb of ould Brian Borhoime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was his way of saying, &ldquo;How come you here&rdquo;? Duke Lawless turned to
      the others before he replied. His eyes fell on the Honourable. With a
      start and a step backward, and with a peculiar angry dryness in his voice,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Trafford!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Honourable, smiling, &ldquo;I have found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found me! And why have you sought me? Me, Duke Lawless? I should have
      thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable interrupted: &ldquo;To tell you that you are Sir Duke Lawless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That? You sought me to tell me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure? And for naught else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live, Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes fixed on the Honourable were searching. Sir Duke hesitated, then
      held out his hand. In a swift but cordial silence it was taken. Nothing
      more could be said then. It is only in plays where gentlemen freely
      discuss family affairs before a curious public. Pretty Pierre was busy
      with a decoction. Jo Gordineer was his associate. Shon had drawn back, and
      was apparently examining the indentations on his gold-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shon, old fellow, come here,&rdquo; said Sir Duke Lawless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shon had received a shock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s little I knew Sir Duke Lawless&mdash;&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s little you needed to know then, or need to know now, Shon, my
      friend. I&rsquo;m Duke Lawless to you here and henceforth, as ever I was then,
      on the wallaby track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Shon believed him. The glasses were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give the toast,&rdquo; said the Honourable with a gentle gravity. &ldquo;To Shon
      McGann and his Tobogan Ride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink to the first half of it with all my heart,&rdquo; said Sir Duke.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I know about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen to that divorce,&rdquo; rejoined Shon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But were it not for the Tobogan Ride we shouldn&rsquo;t have stopped here,&rdquo;
       said the Honourable; &ldquo;and where would this meeting have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alters the case,&rdquo; Sir Duke remarked. &ldquo;I take back the &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      Shon.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever claims Shon had upon the companionship of Sir Duke Lawless, he
      knew there were other claims that were more pressing. After the toast was
      finished, with an emphasised assumption of weariness, and a hint of a long
      yarn on the morrow, he picked up his blanket and started for the room
      where all were to sleep. The real reason of this early departure was clear
      to Pretty Pierre at once, and in due time it dawned upon Jo Gordineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Englishmen, left alone, sat for a few moments silent and smoking
      hard. Then the Honourable rose, got his knapsack, and took out a small
      number of papers, which he handed to Sir Duke, saying, &ldquo;By slow postal
      service to Sir Duke Lawless. Residence, somewhere on one of five
      continents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An envelope bearing a woman&rsquo;s writing was the first thing that met Sir
      Duke&rsquo;s eye. He stared, took it out, turned it over, looked curiously at
      the Honourable for a moment, and then began to break the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Duke. Do not read that. We have something to say to each other
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke laid the letter down. &ldquo;You have some explanation to make,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so long ago; mightn&rsquo;t it be better to go over the story again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is best you should tell it. I am on my defence, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke leaned back, and a frown gathered on his forehead. Strikingly out
      of place on his fresh face it seemed. Looking quickly from the fire to the
      face of the Honourable and back again earnestly, as if the full force of
      what was required came to him, he said: &ldquo;We shall get the perspective
      better if we put the tale in the third person. Duke Lawless was the heir
      to the title and estates of Trafford Court. Next in succession to him was
      Just Trafford, his cousin. Lawless had an income sufficient for a man of
      moderate tastes. Trafford had not quite that, but he had his profession of
      the law. At college they had been fast friends, but afterwards had drifted
      apart, through no cause save difference of pursuits and circumstances.
      Friends they still were and likely to be so always. One summer, when on a
      visit to his uncle, Admiral Sir Clavel Lawless, at Trafford Court, where a
      party of people had been invited for a month, Duke Lawless fell in love
      with Miss Emily Dorset. She did him the honour to prefer him to any other
      man&mdash;at least, he thought so. Her income, however, was limited like
      his own. The engagement was not announced, for Lawless wished to make a
      home before he took a wife. He inclined to ranching in Canada, or a
      planter&rsquo;s life in Queensland. The eight or ten thousand pounds necessary
      was not, however, easy to get for the start, and he hadn&rsquo;t the least
      notion of discounting the future, by asking the admiral&rsquo;s help. Besides,
      he knew his uncle did not wish him to marry unless he married a woman plus
      a fortune. While things were in this uncertain state, Just Trafford
      arrived on a visit to Trafford Court. The meeting of the old friends was
      cordial. Immediately on Trafford&rsquo;s arrival, however, the current of events
      changed. Things occurred which brought disaster. It was noticeable that
      Miss Emily Dorset began to see a deal more of Admiral Lawless and Just
      Trafford, and a deal less of the younger Lawless. One day Duke Lawless
      came back to the house unexpectedly, his horse having knocked up on the
      road. On entering the library he saw what turned the course of his life.&rdquo;
       Sir Duke here paused, sighed, shook the ashes out of his pipe with a grave
      and expressive anxiety which did not properly belong to the action, and
      remained for a moment, both arms on his knees, silent, and looking at the
      fire. Then he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Trafford sat beside Emily Dorset in an attitude of&mdash;say,
      affectionate consideration. She had been weeping, and her whole manner
      suggested very touching confidences. They both rose on the entrance of
      Lawless; but neither tried to say a word. What could they say? Lawless
      apologised, took a book from the table which he had not come for, and
      left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Sir Duke paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The book was an illustrated Much Ado About Nothing,&rdquo; said the Honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few hours after, Lawless had an interview with Emily Dorset. He
      demanded, with a good deal of feeling, perhaps,&mdash;for he was romantic
      enough to love the girl,&mdash;an explanation. He would have asked it of
      Trafford first if he had seen him. She said Lawless should trust her; that
      she had no explanation at that moment to give. If he waited&mdash;but
      Lawless asked her if she cared for him at all, if she wished or intended
      to marry him? She replied lightly, &lsquo;Perhaps, when you become Sir Duke
      Lawless.&rsquo; Then Lawless accused her of heartlessness, and of encouraging
      both his uncle and Just Trafford. She amusingly said, &lsquo;Perhaps she had,
      but it really didn&rsquo;t matter, did it?&rsquo; For reply, Lawless said her interest
      in the whole family seemed active and impartial. He bade her not vex
      herself at all about him, and not to wait until he became Sir Duke
      Lawless, but to give preference to seniority and begin with the title at
      once; which he has reason since to believe that she did. What he said to
      her he has been sorry for, not because he thinks it was undeserved, but
      because he has never been able since to rouse himself to anger on the
      subject, nor to hate the girl and Just Trafford as he ought. Of the dead
      he is silent altogether. He never sought an explanation from Just
      Trafford, for he left that night for London, and in two days was on his
      way to Australia. The day he left, however, he received a note from his
      banker saying that L8000 had been placed to his credit by Admiral Lawless.
      Feeling the indignity of what he believed was the cause of the gift,
      Lawless neither acknowledged it nor used it, not any penny of it. Five
      years have gone since then, and Lawless has wandered over two continents,
      a self-created exile. He has learned much that he didn&rsquo;t learn at Oxford;
      and not the least of all, that the world is not so bad as is claimed for
      it, that it isn&rsquo;t worth while hating and cherishing hate, that evil is
      half-accidental, half-natural, and that hard work in the face of nature is
      the thing to pull a man together and strengthen him for his place in the
      universe. Having burned his ships behind him, that is the way Lawless
      feels. And the story is told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just Trafford sat looking musingly but imperturbably at Sir Duke for a
      minute; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your interpretation of the story, but not the story. Let us turn
      the medal over now. And, first, let Trafford say that he has the
      permission of Emily Dorset&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke interrupted: &ldquo;Of her who was Emily Dorset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Miss Emily Dorset, to tell what she did not tell that day five years
      ago. After this other reading of the tale has been rendered, her letter
      and those documents are there for fuller testimony. Just Trafford&rsquo;s part
      in the drama begins, of course, with the library scene. Now Duke Lawless
      had never known Trafford&rsquo;s half-brother, Hall Vincent. Hall was born in
      India, and had lived there most of his life. He was in the Indian Police,
      and had married a clever, beautiful, but impossible kind of girl, against
      the wishes of her parents. The marriage was not a very happy one. This was
      partly owing to the quick Lawless and Trafford blood, partly to the wife&rsquo;s
      wilfulness. Hall thought that things might go better if he came to England
      to live. On their way from Madras to Colombo he had some words with his
      wife one day about the way she arranged her hair, but nothing serious.
      This was shortly after tiffin. That evening they entered the harbour at
      Colombo; and Hall going to his cabin to seek his wife, could not find her;
      but in her stead was her hair, arranged carefully in flowing waves on the
      pillow, where through the voyage her head had lain. That she had cut it
      off and laid it there was plain; but she could not be found, nor was she
      ever found. The large porthole was open; this was the only clue. But we
      need not go further into that. Hall Vincent came home to England. He told
      his brother the story as it has been told to you, and then left for South
      America, a broken-spirited man. The wife&rsquo;s family came on to England also.
      They did not meet Hall Vincent; but one day Just Trafford met at a country
      seat in Devon, for the first time, the wife&rsquo;s sister. She had not known of
      the relationship between Hall Vincent and the Traffords; and on a
      memorable afternoon he told her the full story of the married life and the
      final disaster, as Hall had told it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke sprang to his feet. &ldquo;You mean, Just, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Emily Dorset was the sister of Hall Vincent&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s brown fingers clasped and unclasped nervously. He was about to
      speak, but the Honourable said: &ldquo;That is only half the story&mdash;wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily Dorset would have told Lawless all in due time, but women don&rsquo;t
      like to be bullied ever so little, and that, and the unhappiness of the
      thing, kept her silent in her short interview with Lawless. She could not
      have guessed that Lawless would go as he did. Now, the secret of her
      diplomacy with the uncle&mdash;diplomacy is the best word to use&mdash;was
      Duke Lawless&rsquo;s advancement. She knew how he had set his heart on the
      ranching or planting life. She would have married him without a penny, but
      she felt his pride in that particular, and respected it. So, like a clever
      girl, she determined to make the old chap give Lawless a cheque on his
      possible future. Perhaps, as things progressed, the same old chap got an
      absurd notion in his head about marrying her to Just Trafford, but that
      was meanwhile all the better for Lawless. The very day that Emily Dorset
      and Just Trafford succeeded in melting Admiral Lawless&rsquo;s heart to the tune
      of eight thousand, was the day that Duke Lawless doubted his friend and
      challenged the loyalty of the girl he loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s eyes filled. &ldquo;Great Heaven! Just&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet for a little. You see she had taken Trafford into her scheme
      against his will, for he was never good at mysteries and theatricals, and
      he saw the danger. But the cause was a good one, and he joined the sweet
      conspiracy, with what result these five years bear witness. Admiral
      Lawless has been dead a year and a half, his wife a year. For he married
      out of anger with Duke Lawless; but he did not marry Emily Dorset, nor did
      he beget a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Australia I saw a paragraph speaking of a visit made by him and Lady
      Lawless to a hospital, and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought he had married Emily Dorset and&mdash;well, you had better
      read that letter now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s face was flushing with remorse and pain. He drew his hand
      quickly across his eyes. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve given up London, your profession,
      everything, just to hunt for me, to tell me this&mdash;you who would have
      profited by my eternal absence! What a beast and ass I&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; only a bit poetical and hasty, which is not unnatural in the
      Lawless blood. I should have been wild myself, maybe, if I had been in
      your position; only I shouldn&rsquo;t have left England, and I should have taken
      the papers regularly and have asked the other fellow to explain. The other
      fellow didn&rsquo;t like the little conspiracy. Women, however, seem to find
      that kind of thing a moral necessity. By the way, I wish when you go back
      you&rsquo;d send me out my hunting traps. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to&mdash;oh,
      quite so&mdash;read the letter&mdash;I forgot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke opened the letter and read it, putting it away from him now and
      then as if it hurt him, and taking it up a moment after to continue the
      reading. The Honourable watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Sir Duke rose. &ldquo;Just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she would have me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Your outfit is not so beautiful as it used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chaff me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so funereal, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the Honourable&rsquo;s matter of fact air Sir Duke&rsquo;s face began to clear.
      &ldquo;Tell me, do you think she still cares for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;s rich now&mdash;got the grandmother&rsquo;s stocking.
      Then there&rsquo;s Pedley, of the Scots Guards; he has been doing loyal service
      for a couple of years. What does the letter say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only tells the truth, as you have told it to me, but from her
      standpoint; not a word that says anything but beautiful reproach and
      general kindness. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. You see it was all four years ago, and Pedley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Honourable paused. He had punished his friend enough. He stepped
      forward and laid his hand on Sir Duke&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Duke, you want to pick
      up the threads where they were dropped. You dropped them. Ask me nothing
      about the ends that Emily Dorset held. I conspire no more. But go you and
      learn your fate. If one remembers, why should the other forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s light heart and eager faith came back with a rush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start
      for England at once. I&rsquo;ll know the worst or the best of it before three
      months are out.&rdquo; The Honourable&rsquo;s slow placidity turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months.&mdash;Yes, you may do it in that time. Better go from
      Victoria to San Francisco and then overland. You&rsquo;ll not forget about my
      hunting traps, and&mdash;oh, certainly, Gordineer; come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Gordineer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to disturb the meeting, but Shon&rsquo;s in
      chancery somehow; breathing like a white pine, and thrashing about! He&rsquo;s
      red-hot with fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he had time to say more, Sir Duke seized the candle and entered the
      room. Shon was moving uneasily and suppressing the groans that shook him.
      &ldquo;Shon, old friend, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pain here, Lawless,&rdquo; laying his hand on his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment Sir Duke said, &ldquo;Pneumonia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that instant thoughts of himself were sunk in the care and thought of
      the man who in the heart of Queensland had been mate and friend and
      brother to him. He did not start for England the next day, nor for many a
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre and Jo Gordineer and his party carried Sir Duke&rsquo;s letters
      over into the Pipi Valley, from where they could be sent on to the coast.
      Pierre came back in a few days to see how Shon was, and expressed his
      determination of staying to help Sir Duke, if need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon hovered between life and death. It was not alone the pneumonia that
      racked his system so; there was also the shock he had received in his
      flight down the glacier. In his delirium he seemed to be always with
      Lawless:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For it&rsquo;s down the long side of Farcalladen Rise&rsquo;&mdash;It&rsquo;s share and
      share even, Lawless, and ye&rsquo;ll ate the rest of it, or I&rsquo;ll lave ye&mdash;Did
      ye say ye&rsquo;d found water&mdash;Lawless&mdash;water!&mdash;Sure you&rsquo;re
      drinkin&rsquo; none yourself&mdash;I&rsquo;ll sing it again for you then&mdash;&lsquo;And
      it&rsquo;s back with the ring of the chain and the spur&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But burn all
      your ships behind you&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never go back to Farcalladen more!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s fingers had a trick of kindness, a suggestion of comfort, a
      sense of healing, that made his simple remedies do more than natural duty.
      He was doctor, nurse,&mdash;sleepless nurse,&mdash;and careful apothecary.
      And when at last the danger was past and he could relax watching, he would
      not go, and he did not go, till they could all travel to the Pipi Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blue shadows of the firs they stand as we take our leave of one of
      them. The Honourable and Sir Duke have had their last words, and Sir Duke
      has said he will remember about the hunting traps. They understand each
      other. There is sunshine in the face of all&mdash;a kind of Indian summer
      sunshine, infused with the sadness of a coming winter; and theirs is the
      winter of parting. Yet it is all done quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again, Shon,&rdquo; said Sir Duke, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll remember your promise
      to write to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my promise, and I hope the news that&rsquo;ll please you best is what
      you&rsquo;ll send us first from England. And if you should go to ould Donegal&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      no words for me thoughts at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them. Don&rsquo;t try to say them. We&rsquo;ve not had the luck together, all
      kinds and all weathers, for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke&rsquo;s eyes smiled a good-bye into the smiling eyes of Shon. They were
      much alike, these two, whose stations were so far apart. Yet somewhere, in
      generations gone, their ancestors may have toiled, feasted, or governed,
      in the same social hemisphere; and here in the mountains life was levelled
      to one degree again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Duke looked round. The pines were crowding up elate and warm towards
      the peaks of the white silence. The river was brawling over a broken
      pathway of boulders at their feet; round the edge of a mighty mountain
      crept a mule train; a far-off glacier glistened harshly in the lucid
      morning, yet not harshly either, but with the rugged form of a vast
      antiquity, from which these scarred and grimly austere hills had grown.
      Here Nature was filled with a sense of triumphant mastery&mdash;the
      mastery of ageless experience. And down the great piles there blew a wind
      of stirring life, of the composure of great strength, and touched the
      four, and the man that mounted now was turned to go. A quick good-bye from
      him to all; a God-speed-you from the Honourable; a wave of the hand
      between the rider and Shon, and Sir Duke Lawless was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better cook the last of that bear this morning, Pierre,&rdquo; said the
      Honourable. And their life went on.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       ........................
</pre>
    <p>
      It was eight months after that, sitting in their hut after a day&rsquo;s
      successful mining, the Honourable handed Shon a newspaper to read. A
      paragraph was marked. It concerned the marriage of Miss Emily Dorset and
      Sir Duke Lawless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Shon read, the Honourable called into the tent: &ldquo;Have you any
      lemons for the whisky, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A satisfactory reply being returned, the Honourable proceeded: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      begin with the bottle of Pommery, which I&rsquo;ve been saving months for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The royal-flush toast of the evening belonged to Shon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless him! To the day when we see him again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all of them saw that day.

      &ldquo;One at our feet, and the other beyond, Shon McGann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sight of my eyes I wish I had in the light of the sun this
      mornin&rsquo;. Tell me, what is&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the trees on the foot-hills, and all the branches shine with frost.
      There is a path&mdash;so wide!&mdash;between two groves of pines. On
      Whiteface Mountain lies a glacier-field... and all is still.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voice of you is far-away-like, Pierre&mdash;it shivers as a hawk
      cries. It&rsquo;s the wind, the wind, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a breath of life from hill or valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I feel it in my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the breath of life you feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not hear voices coming athwart the wind?... Can you see the
      people at the mines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you what I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me of the pine-trees, and the glacier, and the snow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the Valley, in the Valley, where all the miners are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For love of heaven, don&rsquo;t tell me that the dark is fallin&rsquo; on your eyes
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Shon, I am not growing blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not tell me what gives the ache to your words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see in the Valley&mdash;snow... snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a laugh you have at me in your cheek, whin I&rsquo;d give years of my
      ill-spent life to watch the chimney smoke come curlin&rsquo; up slow through the
      sharp air in the Valley there below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no chimney and there is no smoke in all the Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God, if you&rsquo;re a man, you&rsquo;ll put your hand on my arm and tell me
      what trouble quakes your speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shon McGann, it is for you to make the sign of the Cross... there, while
      I put my hand on your shoulder&mdash;so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hand is heavy, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the sight of the eyes that see. In the Valley there is snow; in
      the snow of all that was, there is one poppet-head of the mine that was
      called St. Gabriel... upon the poppet-head there is the figure of a
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not move&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will never move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will never move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The breath o&rsquo; my body hurts me.... There is death in the Valley, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an avalanche&mdash;that path between the pines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a great storm after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God that I cannot behold that thing this day!... And the
      woman, Pierre, the woman aloft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went to watch for someone coming, and as she watched, the avalanche
      came&mdash;and she moves not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we know that woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you whispered soft to yourself, then, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I whispered no word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t you hear it, soft and sighin&rsquo;?... Nathalie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mon Dieu!&rsquo; It is not of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s facin&rsquo; the poppet-head where she stands I&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your face is turned towards her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the sun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun stands still above her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the bitter over, and the avil past, come rest for her and all that
      lie there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, &lsquo;bien,&rsquo; the game is done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we stay here we shall die also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we go we die, perhaps.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spake it. We will go, and we will return when the breath of summer
      comes from the South.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Did you not hear&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hear. I only see an eagle, and it flies towards Whiteface
      Mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Shon McGann and Pretty Pierre turned back from the end of their quest&mdash;from
      a mighty grave behind to a lonely waste before; and though one was
      snow-blind, and the other knew that on him fell the chiefer weight of a
      great misfortune, for he must provide food and fire and be as a mother to
      his comrade&mdash;they had courage; without which, men are as the standing
      straw in an unreaped field in winter; but having become like the hooded
      pine, that keepeth green in frost, and hath the bounding blood in all its
      icy branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whence they came and wherefore was as thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      A French Canadian once lived in Lonely Valley. One day great fortune came
      to him, because it was given him to discover the mine St. Gabriel. And he
      said to the woman who loved him, &ldquo;I will go with mules and much gold, that
      I have hewn and washed and gathered, to a village in the East where my
      father and my mother are. They are poor, but I will make them rich; and
      then I will return to Lonely Valley, and a priest shall come with me, and
      we will dwell here at Whiteface Mountain, where men are men and not
      children.&rdquo; And the woman blessed him, and prayed for him, and let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He travelled far through passes of the mountains, and came at last where
      new cities lay upon the plains, and where men were full of evil and of
      lust of gold. And he was free of hand and light of heart; and at a place
      called Diamond City false friends came about him, and gave him champagne
      wine to drink, and struck him down and robbed him, leaving him for dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was found, and his wounds were all healed: all save one, and that
      was in the brain. Men called him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered through the land, preaching to men to drink no wine, and to
      shun the sight of gold. And they laughed at him, and called him Pere
      Champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day much gold was found at a place called Reef o&rsquo; Angel; and
      jointly with the gold came a plague which scars the face and rots the
      body; and Indians died by hundreds and white men by scores; and Pere
      Champagne, of all who were not stricken down, feared nothing, and did not
      flee, but went among the sick and dying, and did those deeds which gold
      cannot buy, and prayed those prayers which were never sold. And who can
      count how high the prayers of the feckless go!
    </p>
    <p>
      When none was found to bury the dead, he gave them place himself beneath
      the prairie earth,&mdash;consecrated only by the tears of a fool,&mdash;and
      for extreme unction he had but this: &ldquo;God be merciful to me, a sinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it happily chanced that Pierre and Shon McGann, who travelled
      westward, came upon this desperate battle-field, and saw how Pere
      Champagne dared the elements of scourge and death; and they paused and
      laboured with him&mdash;to save where saving was granted of Heaven, and to
      bury when the Reaper reaped and would not stay his hand. At last the
      plague ceased, because winter stretched its wings out swiftly o&rsquo;er the
      plains from frigid ranges in the West. And then Pere Champagne fell ill
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this last great sickness cured his madness: and he remembered whence
      he had come, and what befell him at Diamond City so many moons ago. And he
      prayed them, when he knew his time was come, that they would go to Lonely
      Valley and tell his story to the woman whom he loved; and say that he was
      going to a strange but pleasant Land, and that there he would await her
      coming. He begged them that they would go at once, that she might know,
      and not strain her eyes to blindness, and be sick at heart because he came
      not. And he told them her name, and drew the coverlet up about his head
      and seemed to sleep; but he waked between the day and dark, and gently
      cried: &ldquo;The snow is heavy on the mountain... and the Valley is below....
      &lsquo;Gardez, mon Pere!&rsquo;... Ah, Nathalie!&rdquo; And they buried him between the dark
      and dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though winds were fierce, and travel full of peril, they kept their word,
      and passed along wide steppes of snow, until they entered passes of the
      mountains, and again into the plains; and at last one &lsquo;poudre&rsquo; day, when
      frost was shaking like shreds of faintest silver through the air, Shon
      McGann&rsquo;s sight fled. But he would not turn back&mdash;a promise to a dying
      man was sacred, and he could follow if he could not lead; and there was
      still some pemmican, and there were martens in the woods, and wandering
      deer that good spirits hunted into the way of the needy; and Pierre&rsquo;s
      finger along the gun was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre did not tell Shon that for many days they travelled woods where no
      sunshine entered; where no trail had ever been, nor foot of man had trod:
      that they had lost their way. Nor did he make his comrade know that one
      night he sat and played a game of solitaire to see if they would ever
      reach the place called Lonely Valley. Before the cards were dealt, he made
      a sign upon his breast and forehead. Three times he played, and three
      times he counted victory; and before three suns had come and gone, they
      climbed a hill that perched over Lonely Valley. And of what they saw and
      their hearts felt we know.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they turned their faces eastward they were as men who go to meet
      a final and a conquering enemy; but they had kept their honour with the
      man upon whose grave-tree Shon McGann had carved beneath his name these
      words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;A Brother of Aaron.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Upon a lonely trail they wandered, the spirits of lost travellers
      hungering in their wake&mdash;spirits that mumbled in cedar thickets, and
      whimpered down the flumes of snow. And Pierre, who knew that evil things
      are exorcised by mighty conjuring, sang loudly, from a throat made thin by
      forced fasting, a song with which his mother sought to drive away the
      devils of dreams that flaunted on his pillow when a child: it was the song
      of the Scarlet Hunter. And the charm sufficed; for suddenly of a cheerless
      morning they came upon a trapper&rsquo;s hut in the wilderness, where their
      sufferings ceased, and the sight of Shon&rsquo;s eyes came back. When strength
      returned also, they journeyed to an Indian village, where a priest
      laboured. Him they besought; and when spring came they set forth to Lonely
      Valley again that the woman and the smothered dead&mdash;if it might
      chance so&mdash;should be put away into peaceful graves. But thither
      coming they only saw a grey and churlish river; and the poppet-head of the
      mine of St. Gabriel, and she who had knelt thereon, were vanished into
      solitudes, where only God&rsquo;s cohorts have the rights of burial....
    </p>
    <p>
      But the priest prayed humbly for their so swiftly summoned souls.

    <h2>
      THE SCARLET HUNTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News out of Egypt!&rdquo; said the Honourable Just Trafford. &ldquo;If this is true,
      it gives a pretty finish to the season. You think it possible, Pierre? It
      is every man&rsquo;s talk that there isn&rsquo;t a herd of buffaloes in the whole
      country; but this-eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre did not seem disposed to answer. He had been watching a man&rsquo;s face
      for some time; but his eyes were now idly following the smoke of his
      cigarette as it floated away to the ceiling in fading circles. He seemed
      to take no interest in Trafford&rsquo;s remarks, nor in the tale that Shangi the
      Indian had told them; though Shangi and his tale were both sufficiently
      uncommon to justify attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon McGann was more impressionable. His eyes swam; his feet shifted
      nervously with enjoyment; he glanced frequently at his gun in the corner
      of the hut; he had watched Trafford&rsquo;s face with some anxiety, and accepted
      the result of the tale with delight. Now his look was occupied with
      Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was a pretty good authority in all matters concerning the prairies
      and the North. He also had an instinct for detecting veracity, having
      practised on both sides of the equation. Trafford became impatient, and at
      last the half-breed, conscious that he had tried the temper of his chief
      so far as was safe, lifted his eyes, and, resting them casually on the
      Indian, replied: &ldquo;Yes, I know the place.... No, I have not been there, but
      I was told-ah, it was long ago! There is a great valley between hills, the
      Kimash Hills, the hills of the Mighty Men. The woods are deep and dark;
      there is but one trail through them, and it is old. On the highest hill is
      a vast mound. In that mound are the forefathers of a nation that is gone.
      Yes, as you say, they are dead, and there is none of them alive in the
      valley&mdash;which is called the White Valley&mdash;where the buffalo are.
      The valley is green in summer, and the snow is not deep in winter; the
      noses of the buffalo can find the tender grass. The Injin speaks the
      truth, perhaps. But of the number of buffaloes, one must see. The eye of
      the red man multiplies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trafford looked at Pierre closely. &ldquo;You seem to know the place very well.
      It is a long way north where&mdash;ah yes, you said you had never been
      there; you were told. Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed raised his eyebrows slightly as he replied: &ldquo;I can remember
      a long time, and my mother, she spoke much and sang many songs at the
      campfires.&rdquo; Then he puffed his cigarette so that the smoke clouded his
      face for a moment, and went on,&mdash;&ldquo;I think there may be buffaloes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s along the barrel of me gun I wish I was lookin&rsquo; at thim now,&rdquo; said
      McGann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tiens,&rsquo; you will go&rdquo;? inquired Pierre of Trafford. &ldquo;To have a shot at
      the only herd of wild buffaloes on the continent! Of course I&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;d
      go to the North Pole for that. Sport and novelty I came here to see;
      buffalo-hunting I did not expect. I&rsquo;m in luck, that&rsquo;s all. We&rsquo;ll start
      to-morrow morning, if we can get ready, and Shangi here will lead us; eh,
      Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed again was not polite. Instead of replying he sang almost
      below his breath the words of a song unfamiliar to his companions, though
      the Indian&rsquo;s eyes showed a flash of understanding. These were the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They ride away with a waking wind, away, away!
   With laughing lip and with jocund mind at break of day.
   A rattle of hoofs and a snatch of song, they ride, they ride!
   The plains are wide and the path is long,&mdash;so long, so wide!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Just Trafford appeared ready to deal with this insolence, for the
      half-breed was after all a servant of his, a paid retainer. He waited,
      however. Shon saw the difficulty, and at once volunteered a reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      aisy enough to get away in the mornin&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s a question how far we&rsquo;ll
      be able to go with the horses. The year is late; but there&rsquo;s dogs beyand,
      I suppose, and bedad, there y&rsquo; are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian spoke slowly: &ldquo;It is far off. There is no colour yet in the
      leaf of the larch. The river-hen still swims northward. It is good that we
      go. There is much buffalo in the White Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Trafford looked towards his follower, and again the half-breed, as
      if he were making an effort to remember, sang abstractedly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They follow, they follow a lonely trail, by day, by night,
   By distant sun, and by fire-fly pale, and northern light.
   The ride to the Hills of the Mighty Men, so swift they go!
   Where buffalo feed in the wilding glen in sun and snow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre,&rdquo; said Trafford, sharply, &ldquo;I want an answer to my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mais, pardon,&rsquo; I was thinking... well, we can ride until the deep snows
      come, then we can walk; and Shangi, he can get the dogs, maybe, one team
      of dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;one team of dogs will not be enough. We&rsquo;ll bring
      meat and hides, you know, as well as pemmican. We won&rsquo;t cache any carcases
      up there. What would be the use? We shall have to be back in the Pipi
      Valley by the spring-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the half-breed with a cold decision, &ldquo;one team of dogs will
      be enough; and we will not cache, and we shall be back in the Pipi Valley
      before the spring, perhaps.&rdquo; But this last word was spoken under his
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Indian spoke, with his deep voice and dignified manner:
      &ldquo;Brothers, it is as I have said, the trail is lonely and the woods are
      deep and dark. Since the time when the world was young, no white man hath
      been there save one, and behold sickness fell on him; the grave is his
      end. It is a pleasant land, for the gods have blessed it to the Indian
      forever. No heathen shall possess it. But you shall see the White Valley
      and the buffalo. Shangi will lead, because you have been merciful to him,
      and have given him to sleep in your wigwam, and to eat of your wild meat.
      There are dogs in the forest. I have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trafford was impressed, and annoyed too. He thought too much sentiment was
      being squandered on a very practical and sportive thing. He disliked
      functions; speech-making was to him a matter for prayer and fasting. The
      Indian&rsquo;s address was therefore more or less gratuitous, and he hastened to
      remark: &ldquo;Thank you, Shangi; that&rsquo;s very good, and you&rsquo;ve put it
      poetically. You&rsquo;ve turned a shooting-excursion into a mediaeval romance.
      But we&rsquo;ll get down to business now, if you please, and make the romance a
      fact, beautiful enough to send to the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; or the New York &lsquo;Call&rsquo;.
      Let&rsquo;s see, how would they put it in the Call?&mdash;&lsquo;Extraordinary
      Discovery&mdash;Herd of buffaloes found in the far North by an Englishman
      and his Franco-Irish Party&mdash;Sport for the gods&mdash;Exodus of
      &lsquo;brules&rsquo; to White Valley!&rsquo;&mdash;and so on, screeching to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon laughed heartily. &ldquo;The fun of the world is in the thing,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;and a day it would be for a notch on a stick and a rasp of gin in the
      throat. And if I get the sight of me eye on a buffalo-ruck, it&rsquo;s down on
      me knees I&rsquo;ll go, and not for prayin&rsquo; aither. Here&rsquo;s both hands up for a
      start in the mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long before noon next day they were well on their way. Trafford could not
      understand why Pierre was so reserved, and, when speaking, so ironical. It
      was noticeable that the half-breed watched the Indian closely, that he
      always rode behind him, that he never drank out of the same cup. The
      leader set this down to the natural uncertainty of Pierre&rsquo;s disposition.
      He had grown to like Pierre, as the latter had come in course to respect
      him. Each was a man of value after his kind. Each also had recognised in
      the other qualities of force and knowledge having their generation in
      experiences which had become individuality, subterranean and acute, under
      a cold surface. It was the mutual recognition of these equivalents that
      led the two men to mutual trust, only occasionally disturbed, as has been
      shown; though one was regarded as the most fastidious man of his set in
      London, the fairest-minded of friends, the most comfortable of companions;
      while the other was an outlaw, a half-heathen, a lover of but one thing in
      this world, the joyous god of Chance. Pierre was essentially a gamester.
      He would have extracted satisfaction out of a death-sentence which was
      contingent on the trumping of an ace. His only honour was the honour of
      the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with all the swelling prairie sloping to the clear horizon, and the
      breath of a large life in their nostrils, these two men were caught up
      suddenly, as it were, by the throbbing soul of the North, so that the
      subterranean life in them awoke and startled them. Trafford conceived that
      tobacco was the charm with which to exorcise the spirits of the past.
      Pierre let the game of sensations go on, knowing that they pay themselves
      out in time. His scheme was the wiser. The other found that fast riding
      and smoking were not sufficient. He became surrounded by the ghosts of
      yesterdays; and at length he gave up striving with them, and let them
      storm upon him, until a line of pain cut deeply across his forehead, and
      bitterly and unconsciously he cried aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;Hester, ah, Hester!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But having spoken, the spell was broken, and he was aware of the beat of
      hoofs beside him, and Shangi the Indian looking at him with a half smile.
      Something in the look thrilled him; it was fantastic, masterful. He
      wondered that he had not noticed this singular influence before. After
      all, he was only a savage with cleaner buckskin than his race usually
      wore. Yet that glow, that power in the face&mdash;was he Piegan,
      Blackfoot, Cree, Blood? Whatever he was, this man had heard the words
      which broke so painfully from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the Indian frame her name upon his lips, and then came the words,
      &ldquo;Hester&mdash;Hester Orval!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned sternly, and said, &ldquo;Who are you? What do you know of Hester
      Orval?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian shook his head gravely, and replied, &ldquo;You spoke her name, my
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke one word of her name. You have spoken two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One does not know what one speaks. There are words which are as sounds,
      and words which are as feelings. Those come to the brain through the ear;
      these to the soul through sign, which is more than sound. The Indian hath
      knowledge, even as the white man; and because his heart is open, the trees
      whisper to him; he reads the language of the grass and the wind, and is
      taught by the song of the bird, the screech of the hawk, the bark of the
      fox. And so he comes to know the heart of the man who hath sickness, and
      calls upon someone, even though it be a weak woman, to cure his sickness;
      who is bowed low as beside a grave, and would stand upright. Are not my
      words wise? As the thoughts of a child that dreams, as the face of the
      blind, the eye of the beast, or the anxious hand of the poor, are they not
      simple, and to be understood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just Trafford made no reply. But behind, Pierre was singing in the
      plaintive measure of a chant:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;A hunter rideth the herd abreast,
        The Scarlet Hunter from out of the West,
        Whose arrows with points of flame are drest,
        Who loveth the beast of the field the best,
        The child and the young bird out of the nest,
        They ride to the hunt no more, no more!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They travelled beyond all bounds of civilisation; beyond the northernmost
      Indian villages, until the features of the landscape became more rugged
      and solemn, and at last they paused at a place which the Indian called
      Misty Mountain, and where, disappearing for an hour, he returned with a
      team of Eskimo dogs, keen, quick-tempered, and enduring. They had all now
      recovered from the disturbing sentiments of the first portion of the
      journey; life was at full tide; the spirit of the hunter was on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length one night they camped in a vast pine grove wrapped in coverlets
      of snow and silent as death. Here again Pierre became moody and alert and
      took no part in the careless chat at the camp-fire led by Shon McGann. The
      man brooded and looked mysterious. Mystery was not pleasing to Trafford.
      He had his own secrets, but in the ordinary affairs of life he preferred
      simplicity. In one of the silences that fell between Shon&rsquo;s attempts to
      give hilarity to the occasion, there came a rumbling far-off sound, a
      sound that increased in volume till the earth beneath them responded
      gently to the vibration. Trafford looked up inquiringly at Pierre, and
      then at the Indian, who, after a moment, said slowly: &ldquo;Above us are the
      hills of the Mighty Men, beneath us is the White Valley. It is the tramp
      of buffalo that we hear. A storm is coming, and they go to shelter in the
      mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The information had come somewhat suddenly, and McGann was the first to
      recover from the pleasant shock: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s divil a wink of sleep I&rsquo;ll get this
      night, with the thought of them below there ripe for slaughter, and the
      tumble of fight in their beards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, with a meaning glance from his half-closed eyes, added: &ldquo;But it is
      the old saying of the prairies that you do not shout dinner till you have
      your knife in the loaf. Your knife is not yet in the loaf, Shon McGann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boom of the trampling ceased, and now there was a stirring in the
      snow-clad tree tops, and a sound as if all the birds of the North were
      flying overhead. The weather began to moan and the boles of the pines to
      quake. And then there came war,&mdash;a trouble out of the north, a wave
      of the breath of God to show inconsequent man that he who seeks to live by
      slaughter hath slaughter for his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hung over the fire while the forest cracked round them, and the flame
      smarted with the flying snow. And now the trees, as if the elements were
      closing in on them, began to break close by, and one lurched forward
      towards them. Trafford, to avoid its stroke, stepped quickly aside right
      into the line of another which he did not see. Pierre sprang forward and
      swung him clear, but was himself struck senseless by an outreaching
      branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if satisfied with this achievement, the storm began to subside. When
      Pierre recovered consciousness Trafford clasped his hand and said,&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      a sharp eye, a quick thought, and a deft arm, comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it was in the game. It is good play to assist your partner,&rdquo; the
      half-breed replied sententiously. Through all, the Indian had remained
      stoical. But McGann, who swore by Trafford&mdash;as he had once sworn by
      another of the Trafford race&mdash;had his heart on his lips, and said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a swate little cherub that sits up aloft,
     Who cares for the soul of poor Jack!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was long after midnight ere they settled down again, with the wreck of
      the forest round them. Only the Indian slept; the others were alert and
      restless. They were up at daybreak, and on their way before sunrise,
      filled with desire for prey. They had not travelled far before they
      emerged upon a plateau. Around them were the hills of the Mighty Men&mdash;austere,
      majestic; at their feet was a vast valley on which the light newly-fallen
      snow had not hidden all the grass. Lonely and lofty, it was a world
      waiting chastely to be peopled! And now it was peopled, for there came
      from a cleft of the hills an army of buffaloes lounging slowly down the
      waste, with tossing manes and hoofs stirring the snow into a feathery
      scud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Trafford and McGann swam; Pierre&rsquo;s face was troubled, and
      strangely enough he made the sign of the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Trafford saw smoke issuing from a spot on the mountain
      opposite. He turned to the Indian: &ldquo;Someone lives there&rdquo;? he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the home of the dead, but life is also there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man, or Indian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no reply came. The Indian pointed instead to the buffalo rumbling down
      the valley. Trafford forgot the smoke, forgot everything except that
      splendid quarry. Shon was excited. &ldquo;Sarpints alive,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;look at the
      troops of thim! Is it standin&rsquo; here we are with our tongues in our cheeks,
      whin there&rsquo;s bastes to be killed, and mate to be got, and the call to war
      on the ground below! Clap spurs with your heels, sez I, and down the side
      of the turf together and give &lsquo;em the teeth of our guns!&rdquo; The Irishman
      dashed down the slope. In an instant, all followed, or at least Trafford
      thought all followed, swinging their guns across their saddles to be ready
      for this excellent foray. But while Pierre rode hard, it was at first
      without the fret of battle in him, and he smiled strangely, for he knew
      that the Indian had disappeared as they rode down the slope, though how
      and why he could not tell. There ran through his head tales chanted at
      camp-fires when he was not yet in stature so high as the loins that bore
      him. They rode hard, and yet they came no nearer to that flying herd
      straining on with white streaming breath and the surf of snow rising to
      their quarters. Mile upon mile, and yet they could not ride these monsters
      down!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Pierre was leading. There was a kind of fury in his face, and he
      seemed at last to gain on them. But as the herd veered close to a wall of
      stalwart pines, a horseman issued from the trees and joined the cattle.
      The horseman was in scarlet from head to foot; and with his coming the
      herd went faster, and ever faster, until they vanished into the
      mountain-side; and they who pursued drew in their trembling horses and
      stared at each other with wonder in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name what does it mean&rdquo;? Trafford cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a trick of the eye or the hand of the devil&rdquo;? added Shon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God we shall know perhaps. If it is the hand of the devil
      it is not good for us,&rdquo; remarked Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the man in scarlet who came from the woods&rdquo;? asked Trafford of
      the half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Voila,&rsquo; it is strange! There is an old story among the Indians! My
      mother told many tales of the place and sang of it, as I sang to you. The
      legend was this:&mdash;In the hills of the North which no white man, nor
      no Injin of this time hath seen, the forefathers of the red men sleep; but
      some day they will wake again and go forth and possess all the land; and
      the buffalo are for them when that time shall come, that they may have the
      fruits of the chase, and that it be as it was of old, when the cattle were
      as clouds on the horizon. And it was ordained that one of these mighty men
      who had never been vanquished in fight, nor done an evil thing, and was
      the greatest of all the chiefs, should live and not die, but be as a
      sentinel, as a lion watching, and preserve the White Valley in peace until
      his brethren waked and came into their own again. And him they called the
      Scarlet Hunter; and to this hour the red men pray to him when they lose
      their way upon the plains, or Death draws aside the curtains of the wigwam
      to call them forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeat the verses you sang, Pierre,&rdquo; said Trafford. The half-breed did
      so. When he came to the words, &ldquo;Who loveth the beast of the field the
      best,&rdquo; the Englishman looked round. &ldquo;Where is Shangi&rdquo;? he asked. McGann
      shook his head in astonishment and negation. Pierre explained: &ldquo;On the
      mountain-side where we ride down he is not seen&mdash;he vanish... &lsquo;mon
      Dieu,&rsquo; look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the slope of the mountain stood the Scarlet Hunter with drawn bow. From
      it an arrow flew over their heads with a sorrowful twang, and fell where
      the smoke rose among the pines; then the mystic figure disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGann shuddered, and drew himself together. &ldquo;It is the place of spirits,&rdquo;
       he said; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s little I like it, God knows; but I&rsquo;ll follow that
      Scarlet Hunter, or red devil, or whatever he is, till I drop, if the
      Honourable gives the word. For flesh and blood I&rsquo;m not afraid of; and the
      other we come to, whether we will or not, one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Trafford said: &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll let it stand where it is for the present.
      Something has played our eyes false, or we&rsquo;re brought here to do work
      different from buffalo-hunting. Where that arrow fell among the smoke we
      must go first. Then, as I read the riddle, we travel back the way we came.
      There are points in connection with the Pipi Valley superior to the hills
      of the Mighty Men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rode away across the glade, and through a grove of pines upon a hill,
      till they stood before a log but with parchment windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trafford knocked, but there was no response. He opened the door and
      entered. He saw a figure rise painfully from a couch in a corner,&mdash;the
      figure of a woman young and beautiful, but wan and worn. She seemed dazed
      and inert with suffering, and spoke mournfully: &ldquo;It is too late. Not you,
      nor any of your race, nor anything on earth can save him. He is dead&mdash;dead
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of her voice Trafford started. He drew near to her, as
      pale as she was, and wonder and pity were in his face. &ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;Hester Orval!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him like one that had been awakened from an evil dream, then
      tottered towards him with the cry,&mdash;&ldquo;Just, Just, have you come to
      save me? O Just!&rdquo; His distress was sad to see, for it was held in deep
      repression, but he said calmly and with protecting gentleness: &ldquo;Yes, I
      have come to save you. Hester, how is it you are here in this strange
      place&mdash;you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed so that at first she could not answer; but at last she cried:
      &ldquo;O Just, he is dead... in there, in there!... Last night, it was last
      night; and he prayed that I might go with him. But I could not die
      unforgiven, and I was right, for you have come out of the world to help
      me, and to save me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to help you and to save you,&mdash;if I can,&rdquo; he added in a whisper
      to himself, for he was full of foreboding. He was of the earth, earthy,
      and things that had chanced to him this day were beyond the natural and
      healthy movements of his mind. He had gone forth to slay, and had been
      foiled by shadows; he had come with a tragic, if beautiful, memory
      haunting him, and that memory had clothed itself in flesh and stood before
      him, pitiful, solitary,&mdash;a woman. He had scorned all legend and
      superstition, and here both were made manifest to him. He had thought of
      this woman as one who was of this world no more, and here she mourned
      before him and bade him go and look upon her dead, upon the man who had
      wronged him, into whom, as he once declared, the soul of a cur had
      entered,&mdash;and now what could he say? He had carried in his heart the
      infinite something that is to men the utmost fulness of life, which,
      losing, they must carry lead upon their shoulders where they thought the
      gods had given pinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGann and Pierre were nervous. This conjunction of unusual things was
      easier to the intelligences of the dead than the quick. The outer air was
      perhaps less charged with the unnatural, and with a glance towards the
      room where death was quartered, they left the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trafford was alone with the woman through whom his life had been turned
      awry. He looked at her searchingly; and as he looked the mere man in him
      asserted itself for a moment. She was dressed in coarse garments; it
      struck him that her grief had a touch of commonness about it; there was
      something imperfect in the dramatic setting. His recent experiences had
      had a kind of grandeur about them; it was not thus that he had remembered
      her in the hour when he had called upon her in the plains, and the Indian
      had heard his cry. He felt, and was ashamed in feeling, that there was a
      grim humour in the situation. The fantastic, the melodramatic, the
      emotional, were huddled here in too marked a prominence; it all seemed,
      for an instant, like the tale of a woman&rsquo;s first novel. But immediately
      again there was roused in him the latent force of loyalty to himself and
      therefore to her; the story of her past, so far as he knew it, flashed
      before him, and his eyes grew hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the time he had last seen her in an English country-house
      among a gay party in which royalty smiled, and the subject was content
      beneath the smile. But there was one rebellious subject, and her name was
      Hester Orval. She was a wilful girl who had lived life selfishly within
      the lines of that decorous yet pleasant convention to which she was born.
      She was beautiful,&mdash;she knew that, and royalty had graciously
      admitted it. She was warm-thoughted, and possessed the fatal strain of the
      artistic temperament. She was not sure that she had a heart; and many
      others, not of her sex, after varying and enthusiastic study of the
      matter, were not more confident than she. But it had come at last that she
      had listened with pensive pleasure to Trafford&rsquo;s tale of love; and because
      to be worshipped by a man high in all men&rsquo;s, and in most women&rsquo;s, esteem,
      ministered delicately to her sweet egotism, and because she was proud of
      him, she gave him her hand in promise, and her cheek in privilege, but
      denied him&mdash;though he knew this not&mdash;her heart and the service
      of her life. But he was content to wait patiently for that service, and he
      wholly trusted her, for there was in him some fine spirit of the antique
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had come to Falkenstowe, this country-house and her father&rsquo;s home, a
      man who bore a knightly name, but who had no knightly heart; and he told
      Ulysses&rsquo; tales, and covered a hazardous and cloudy past with that
      fascinating colour which makes evil appear to be good, so that he roused
      in her the pulse of art, which she believed was soul and life, and her
      allegiance swerved. And when her mother pleaded with her, and when her
      father said stern things, and even royalty, with uncommon use, rebuked her
      gently, her heart grew hard; and almost on the eve of her wedding-day she
      fled with her lover, and married him, and together they sailed away over
      the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world was shocked and clamorous for a matter of nine days, and then it
      forgot this foolish and awkward circumstance; but Just Trafford never
      forgot it. He remembered all vividly until the hour, a year later, when
      London journals announced that Hester Orval and her husband had gone down
      with a vessel wrecked upon the Alaskan and Canadian coast. And there new
      regret began, and his knowledge of her ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she and her husband had not been drowned; with a sailor they had
      reached the shore in safety. They had travelled inland from the coast
      through the great mountains by unknown paths, and as they travelled, the
      sailor died; and they came at last through innumerable hardships to the
      Kimash Hills, the hills of the Mighty Men, and there they stayed. It was
      not an evil land; it had neither deadly cold in winter nor wanton heat in
      summer. But they never saw a human face, and everything was lonely and
      spectral. For a time they strove to go eastwards or southwards but the
      mountains were impassable, and in the north and west there was no hope.
      Though the buffalo swept by them in the valley they could not slay them,
      and they lived on forest fruits until in time the man sickened. The woman
      nursed him faithfully, but still he failed; and when she could go forth no
      more for food, some unseen dweller of the woods brought buffalo meat, and
      prairie fowl, and water from the spring, and laid them beside her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen the mounds upon the hill, the wide couches of the sleepers,
      and she remembered the things done in the days when God seemed nearer to
      the sons of men than now; and she said that a spirit had done this thing,
      and trembled and was thankful. But the man weakened and knew that he
      should die, and one night when the pain was sharp upon him he prayed
      bitterly that he might pass, or that help might come to snatch him from
      the grave. And as they sobbed together, a form entered at the door,&mdash;a
      form clothed in scarlet,&mdash;and he bade them tell the tale of their
      lives as they would some time tell it unto heaven. And when the tale was
      told he said that succour should come to them from the south by the hand
      of the Scarlet Hunter, that the nation sleeping there should no more be
      disturbed by their moaning. And then he had gone forth, and with his going
      there was a storm such as that in which the man had died, the storm that
      had assailed the hunters in the forest yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the second part of Hester Orval&rsquo;s life as she told it to Just
      Trafford. And he, looking into her eyes, knew that she had suffered, and
      that she had sounded her husband&rsquo;s unworthiness. Then he turned from her
      and went into the room where the dead man lay. And there all hardness
      passed from him, and he understood that in the great going forth man
      reckons to the full with the deeds done in that brief pilgrimage called
      life; and that in the bitter journey which this one took across the dread
      spaces between Here and There, he had repented of his sins, because they,
      and they only, went with him in mocking company; the good having gone
      first to plead where evil is a debtor and hath a prison. And the woman
      came and stood beside Trafford, and whispered, &ldquo;At first&mdash;and at the
      last&mdash;he was kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he urged her gently from the room: &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;go away. We
      cannot judge him. Leave me alone with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They buried him upon the hill-side, far from the mounds where the Mighty
      Men waited for their summons to go forth and be the lords of the North
      again. At night they buried him when the moon was at its full; and he had
      the fragrant pines for his bed, and the warm darkness to cover him; and
      though he is to those others resting there a heathen and an alien, it may
      be that he sleeps peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Trafford questioned Hester Orval more deeply of her life there, the
      unearthly look quickened in her eyes, and she said: &ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing
      is real here, but suffering; perhaps it is all a dream, but it has changed
      me, changed me. To hear the tread of the flying herds, to see no being
      save him, the Scarlet Hunter, to hear the voices calling in the night!...
      Hush! There, do you not hear them? It is midnight&mdash;listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened, and Pierre and Shon McGann looked at each other
      apprehensively, while Shon&rsquo;s fingers felt hurriedly along the beads of a
      rosary which he did not hold. Yes, they heard it, a deep sonorous sound:
      &ldquo;Is the daybreak come?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is still the night,&rdquo; came the reply as of one
      clear voice. And then there floated through the hills more softly: &ldquo;We
      sleep&mdash;we sleep!&rdquo; And the sounds echoed through the valley&mdash;&ldquo;Sleep&mdash;sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet though these things were full of awe, the spirit of the place held
      them there, and the fever of the hunter descended on them hotly. In the
      morning they went forth, and rode into the White Valley where the buffalo
      were feeding, and sought to steal upon them; but the shots from their guns
      only awoke the hills, and none were slain. And though they rode swiftly,
      the wide surf of snow was ever between them and the chase, and their
      striving availed nothing. Day after day they followed that flying column,
      and night after night they heard the sleepers call from the hills. The
      desire of the thing wasted them, and they forgot to eat and ceased to talk
      among themselves. But one day Shon McGann, muttering aves as he rode,
      gained on the cattle, until once again the Scarlet Hunter came forth from
      a cleft of the mountains, and drove the herd forward with swifter feet.
      But the Irishman had learned the power in this thing, and had taught
      Trafford, who knew not those availing prayers, and with these sacred
      conjurations on their lips they gained on the cattle length by length,
      though the Scarlet Hunter rode abreast of the thundering horde. Within
      easy range, Trafford swung his gun shoulder-wards to fire, but at that
      instant a cloud of snow rose up between him and his quarry so that they
      all were blinded. And when they came into the clear sun again the buffalo
      were gone; but flaming arrows from some unseen hunter&rsquo;s bow came singing
      over their heads towards the south; and they obeyed the sign, and went
      back to where Hester wore her life out with anxiety for them, because she
      knew the hopelessness of their quest. Women are nearer to the heart of
      things. And now she begged Trafford to go southwards before winter froze
      the plains impassably, and the snow made tombs of the valleys. Thereupon
      he gave the word to go, and said that he had done wrong&mdash;for now the
      spell was falling from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she, seeing his regret, said: &ldquo;Ah, Just, it could not have been
      different. The passion of it was on you as it was on us, as if to teach us
      that hunger for happiness is robbery, and that the covetous desire of man
      is not the will of the gods. The herds are for the Mighty Men when they
      awake, not for the stranger and the Philistine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have grown wise, Hester,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sick in brain and body; but it may be that in such sickness
      there is wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it has turned my head, I think. Once I laughed at all such
      fanciful things as these. This Scarlet Hunter, how many times have you
      seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were his looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A face pale and strong, with noble eyes; and in his voice there was
      something strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trafford thought of Shangi, the Indian,&mdash;where had he gone? He had
      disappeared as suddenly as he had come to their camp in the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat silent in the growing night, the door opened and the Scarlet
      Hunter stood before them. &ldquo;There is food,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the threshold&mdash;food
      for those who go upon a far journey to the South in the morning. Unhappy
      are they who seek for gold at the rainbow&rsquo;s foot, who chase the fire-fly
      in the night, who follow the herds in the White Valley. Wise are they who
      anger not the gods, and who fly before the rising storm. There is a path
      from the valley for the strangers, the path by which they came; and when
      the sun stares forth again upon the world, the way shall be open, and
      there shall be safety for you until your travel ends in the quick world
      whither you go. You were foolish; now you are wise. It is time to depart;
      seek not to return, that we may have peace and you safety. When the world
      cometh to her spring again we shall meet.&rdquo; Then he turned and was gone,
      with Trafford&rsquo;s voice ringing after him,&mdash;&ldquo;Shangi! Shangi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ran out swiftly, but he had vanished. In the valley where the
      moonlight fell in icy coldness a herd of cattle was moving, and their
      breath rose like the spray from sea-beaten rocks, and the sound of their
      breathing was borne upwards to the watchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak they rode down into the valley. All was still. Not a trace of
      life remained; not a hoofmark in the snow, nor a bruised blade of grass.
      And when they climbed to the plateau and looked back, it seemed to
      Trafford and his companions, as it seemed in after years, that this thing
      had been all a fantasy. But Hester&rsquo;s face was beside them, and it told of
      strange and unsubstantial things. The shadows of the middle world were
      upon her. And yet again when they turned at the last there was no token.
      It was a northern valley, with sun and snow, and cold blue shadows, and
      the high hills,&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hester said: &ldquo;O Just, I do not know if this is life or death&mdash;and
      yet it must be death, for after death there is forgiveness to those who
      repent, and your face is forgiving and kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he&mdash;for he saw that she needed much human help and comfort&mdash;gently
      laid his hand on hers and replied: &ldquo;Hester, this is life, a new life for
      both of us. Whatever has been was a dream; whatever is now&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      folded her hand in his&mdash;&ldquo;is real; and there is no such thing as
      forgiveness to be spoken of between us. There shall be happiness for us
      yet, please God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go to Falkenstowe. Will&mdash;will my mother forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mothers always forgive, Hester, else half the world had slain itself in
      shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she smiled for the first time since he had seen her. This was in
      the shadows of the scented pines; and a new life breathed upon her, as it
      breathed upon them all, and they knew that the fever of the White Valley
      had passed away from them forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many hardships they came in safety to the regions of the south
      country again; and the tale they told, though doubted by the race of
      pale-faces, was believed by the heathen; because there was none among them
      but, as he cradled at his mother&rsquo;s breasts, and from his youth up, had
      heard the legend of the Scarlet Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the romance of that journey, it concerned only the man and woman to
      whom it was as wine and meat to the starving. Is not love more than
      legend, and a human heart than all the beasts of the field or any joy of
      slaughter?

    <h2>
      THE STONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Stone hung on a jutting crag of Purple Hill. On one side of it, far
      beneath, lay the village, huddled together as if, through being close
      compacted, its handful of humanity should not be a mere dust in the
      balance beside Nature&rsquo;s portentousness. Yet if one stood beside The Stone,
      and looked down, the flimsy wooden huts looked like a barrier at the end
      of a great flume. For the hill hollowed and narrowed from The Stone to the
      village, as if giants had made this concave path by trundling boulders to
      that point like a funnel where the miners&rsquo; houses now formed a cul-de-sac.
      On the other side of the crag was a valley also; but it was lonely and
      untenanted; and at one flank of The Stone were serried legions of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stone was a mighty and wonderful thing. Looked at from the village
      direct, it had nothing but the sky for a background. At times, also, it
      appeared to rest on nothing; and many declared that they could see clean
      between it and the oval floor of the crag on which it rested. That was
      generally in the evening, when the sun was setting behind it. Then the
      light coiled round its base, between it and its pedestal, thus making it
      appear to hover above the hill-point, or, planet-like, to be just settling
      on it. At other times, when the light was perfectly clear and not too
      strong, and the village side of the crag was brighter than the other, more
      accurate relations of The Stone to its pedestal could be discovered. Then
      one would say that it balanced on a tiny base, a toe of granite. But if
      one looked long, especially in the summer, when the air throbbed, it
      evidently rocked upon that toe; if steadily, and very long, he grew
      tremulous, perhaps afraid. Once, a woman who was about to become a mother
      went mad, because she thought The Stone would hurtle down the hill at her
      great moment and destroy her and her child. Indians would not live either
      on the village side of The Stone or in the valley beyond. They had a
      legend that, some day, one, whom they called The Man Who Sleeps, would
      rise from his hidden couch in the mountains, and, being angry that any
      dared to cumber his playground, would hurl The Stone upon them that dwelt
      at Purple Hill. But white men pay little heed to Indian legends. At one
      time or another every person who had come to the village visited The
      Stone. Colossal as it was, the real base on which its weight rested was
      actually very small: the view from the village had not been all deceitful.
      It is possible, indeed, that at one time it had really rocked, and that
      the rocking had worn for it a shallow cup, or socket, in which it poised.
      The first man who came to Purple Valley prospecting had often stopped his
      work and looked at The Stone in a half-fear that it would spring upon him
      unawares. And yet he had as often laughed at himself for doing so, since,
      as he said, it must have been there hundreds of thousands of years.
      Strangers, when they came to the village, went to sleep somewhat timidly
      the first night of their stay, and not infrequently left their beds to go
      and look at The Stone, as it hung there ominously in the light of the
      moon; or listened towards it if it was dark. When the moon rose late, and
      The Stone chanced to be directly in front of it, a black sphere seemed to
      be rolling into the light to blot it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none who lived in the village looked upon The Stone in quite the same
      fashion as did that first man who had come to the valley. He had seen it
      through three changing seasons, with no human being near him, and only
      occasionally a shy, wandering elk, or a cloud of wild ducks whirring down
      the pass, to share his companionship with it. Once he had waked in the
      early morning, and, possessed of a strange feeling, had gone out to look a
      The Stone. There, perched upon it, was an eagle; and though he said to
      himself that an eagle&rsquo;s weight was to The Stone as a feather upon the
      world, he kept his face turned towards it all day; for all day the eagle
      stayed. He was a man of great stature and immense strength. The thews of
      his limbs stood out like soft unbreakable steel. Yet, as if to cast
      derision on his strength and great proportions, God or Fate turned his
      bread to ashes, gave failure into his hands where he hugely grasped at
      fortune, and hung him about with misery. He discovered gold, but others
      gathered it. It was his daughter that went mad, and gave birth to a dead
      child in fearsome thought of The Stone. Once, when he had gone over the
      hills to another mining field, and had been prevented from coming back by
      unexpected and heavy snows, his wife was taken ill, and died alone of
      starvation, because none in the village remembered of her and her needs.
      Again, one wild night, long after, his only son was taken from his bed and
      lynched for a crime that was none of his, as was discovered by his
      murderers next day. Then they killed horribly the real criminal, and
      offered the father such satisfaction as they could. They said that any one
      of them was ready there to be killed by him; and they threw a weapon at
      his feet. At this he stood looking upon them for a moment, his great
      breast heaving, and his eyes glowering; but presently he reached out his
      arms, and taking two of them by the throat, brought their heads together
      heavily, breaking their skulls; and, with a cry in his throat like a
      wounded animal, left them, and entered the village no more. But it became
      known that he had built a rude but on Purple Hill, and that he had been
      seen standing beside The Stone or sitting among the boulders below it,
      with his face bent upon the village. Those who had come near to him said
      that he had greatly changed; that his hair and beard had grown long and
      strong, and, in effect, that he looked like some rugged fragment of an
      antique world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came when they associated The Man with The Stone: they grew to
      speak of him simply as The Man. There was something natural and apt in the
      association. Then they avoided these two singular dwellers on the height.
      What had happened to The Man when he lived in the village became almost as
      great a legend as the Indian fable concerning The Stone. In the minds of
      the people one seemed as old as the other. Women who knew the awful
      disasters which had befallen The Man brooded at times most timidly,
      regarding him as they did at first&mdash;and even still&mdash;The Stone.
      Women who carried life unborn about with them had a strange dread of both
      The Stone and The Man. Time passed on, and the feeling grew that The Man&rsquo;s
      grief must be a terrible thing, since he lived alone with The Stone and
      God. But this did not prevent the men of the village from digging gold,
      drinking liquor, and doing many kinds of evil. One day, again, they did an
      unjust and cruel thing. They took Pierre, the gambler, whom they had at
      first sought to vanquish at his own art, and, possessed suddenly of the
      high duty of citizenship, carried him to the edge of a hill and dropped
      him over, thinking thereby to give him a quick death, while the vultures
      would provide him a tomb. But Pierre was not killed, though to his grave&mdash;unprepared
      as yet&mdash;he would bear an arm which should never be lifted higher than
      his shoulder. When he waked from the crashing gloom which succeeded the
      fall, he was in the presence of a being whose appearance was awesome and
      massive&mdash;an outlawed god: whose hair and beard were white, whose eye
      was piercing, absorbing, painful, in the long perspective of its woe. This
      being sat with his great hand clasped to the side of his head. The
      beginning of his look was the village, and&mdash;though the vision seemed
      infinite&mdash;the village was the end of it too. Pierre, looking through
      the doorway beside which he lay, drew in his breath sharply, for it seemed
      at first as if The Man was an unnatural fancy, and not a thing. Behind The
      Man was The Stone, which was not more motionless nor more full of age than
      this its comrade. Indeed, The Stone seemed more a thing of life as it
      poised above the hill: The Man was sculptured rock. His white hair was
      chiselled on his broad brow, his face was a solemn pathos petrified, his
      lips were curled with an iron contempt, an incalculable anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun went down, and darkness gathered about The Man. Pierre reached out
      his hand, and drank the water and ate the coarse bread that had been put
      near him. He guessed that trees or protruding ledges had broken his fall,
      and that he had been rescued and brought here. As he lay thinking, The Man
      entered the doorway, stooping much to do so. With flints he lighted a wick
      which hung from a wooden bowl of bear&rsquo;s oil; then kneeling, held it above
      his head, and looked at Pierre. And Pierre, who had never feared anyone,
      shrank from the look in The Man&rsquo;s eyes. But when the other saw that Pierre
      was awake, a distant kindness came upon his face, and he nodded gravely;
      but he did not speak. Presently a great tremor as of pain shook all his
      limbs, and he set the candle on the ground, and with his stalwart hands
      arranged afresh the bandages about Pierre&rsquo;s injured arm and leg. Pierre
      spoke at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are The Man&rdquo;? he said. The other bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saved me from those devils in the valley?&rdquo; A look of impregnable
      hardness came into The Man&rsquo;s face, but he pressed Pierre&rsquo;s hand for
      answer; and though the pressure was meant to be gentle, Pierre winced
      painfully. The candle spluttered, and the hut filled with a sickly smoke.
      The Man brought some bear skins and covered the sufferer, for, the season
      being autumn, the night was cold. Pierre, who had thus spent his first
      sane and conscious hour in many days, fell asleep. What time it was when
      he waked he was not sure, but it was to hear a metallic click-click come
      to him through the clear air of night. It was a pleasant noise as of steel
      and rock: the work of some lonely stone-cutter of the hills. The sound
      reached him with strange, increasing distinctness. Was this Titan that had
      saved him sculpturing some figure from the metal hill? Click-click! it
      vibrated as regularly as the keen pulse of a watch. He lay and wondered
      for a long time, but fell asleep again; and the steely iteration went on
      in his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning The Man came to him, and cared for his hurts, and gave him
      food; but still would speak no word. He was gone nearly all day in the
      hills; yet when evening came he sought the place where Pierre had seen him
      the night before, and the same weird scene was re-enacted. And again in
      the night the clicking sound went on; and every night it was renewed.
      Pierre grew stronger, and could, with difficulty, stand upon his feet. One
      night he crept out, and made his way softly, slowly towards the sound. He
      saw The Man kneeling beside The Stone, he saw a hammer rise and fall upon
      a chisel; and the chisel was at the base of The Stone. The hammer rose and
      fell with perfect but dreadful precision. Pierre turned and looked towards
      the village below, whose lights were burning like a bunch of fire-flies in
      the gloom. Again he looked at The Stone and The Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thing came to him sharply. The Man was chiselling away the socket
      of The Stone, bringing it to that point of balance where the touch of a
      finger, the wing of a bird, or the whistle of a north-west wind, would
      send it down upon the offending and unsuspecting village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought held him paralysed. The Man had nursed his revenge long past
      the thought of its probability by the people beneath. He had at first sat
      and watched the village, hated, and mused dreadfully upon the thing he had
      determined to do. Then he had worked a little, afterwards more, and now,
      lastly, since he had seen what they had done to Pierre, with the hot but
      firm eagerness of an avenging giant. Pierre had done some sad deeds in his
      time, and had tasted some sweet revenges, but nothing like to this had
      ever entered his brain. In that village were men who&mdash;as they thought&mdash;had
      cast him to a death fit only for a coward or a cur. Well, here was the
      most exquisite retaliation. Though his hand should not be in the thing, he
      could still be the cynical and approving spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet: had all those people hovering about those lights below done harm
      to him? He thought there were a few&mdash;and they were women&mdash;who
      would not have followed his tumbril to his death with cries of execration.
      The rest would have done so,&mdash;most of them did so, not because he was
      a criminal, but because he was a victim, and because human nature as it is
      thirsts inordinately at times for blood and sacrifice&mdash;a living
      strain of the old barbaric instinct. He remembered that most of these
      people were concerned in having injured The Man. The few good women there
      had vile husbands; the few pardonable men had hateful wives: the village
      of Purple Hill was an ill affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought: now doubtfully, now savagely, now with irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hammer and steel clicked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the lights of the village again. Suddenly there came to his
      mind the words of a great man who sought to save a city manifold centuries
      ago. He was not sure that he wished to save this village; but there was a
      grim, almost grotesque, fitness in the thing that he now intended. He
      spoke out clearly through the night:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once:
      Peradventure ten righteous shall be found there.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hammer stopped. There was a silence, in which the pines sighed
      lightly. Then, as if speaking was a labour, The Man replied in a deep,
      harsh voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not spare it for ten&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a silence, in which Pierre felt his maimed body bend
      beneath him; but presently the voice said,&mdash;&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the moon swung from behind a cloud. The Man stood behind The
      Stone. His arm was raised to it. There was a moment&rsquo;s pause&mdash;it
      seemed like years to Pierre; a wind came softly crying out of the west,
      the moon hurried into the dark, and then a monster sprang from its
      pedestal upon Purple Hill, and, with a sound of thunder and an awful
      speed, raced upon the village below. The boulders of the hillside crumbled
      after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pierre saw the lights go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon shone out again for an instant, and Pierre saw that The Man stood
      where The Stone had been; but when he reached the place The Man was gone.
      Forever!

    <h2>
      THE TALL MASTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The story has been so much tossed about in the mouths of Indians, and
      half-breeds, and men of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, that you are pretty sure
      to hear only an apocryphal version of the thing as you now travel in the
      North. But Pretty Pierre was at Fort Luke when the battle occurred, and,
      before and after, he sifted the business thoroughly. For he had a
      philosophical turn, and this may be said of him, that he never lied except
      to save another from danger. In this matter he was cool and impartial from
      first to last, and evil as his reputation was in many ways there were
      those who believed and trusted him. Himself, as he travelled here and
      there through the North, had heard of the Tall Master. Yet he had never
      met anyone who had seen him; for the Master had dwelt, it was said,
      chiefly among the strange tribes of the Far-Off Metal River whose faces
      were almost white, and who held themselves aloof from the southern races.
      The tales lost nothing by being retold, even when the historians were the
      men of the H. B. C.;&mdash;-Pierre knew what accomplished liars may be
      found among that Company of Adventurers trading in Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, and how
      their art had been none too delicately engrafted by his own people. But he
      was, as became him, open to conviction, especially when, journeying to
      Fort Luke, he heard what John Hybar, the Chief Factor&mdash;a man of
      uncommon quality&mdash;had to say. Hybar had once lived long among those
      Indians of the Bright Stone, and had seen many rare things among them. He
      knew their legends of the White Valley and the Hills of the Mighty Men,
      and how their distinctive character had imposed itself on the whole Indian
      race of the North, so that there was none but believed, even though
      vaguely, in a pleasant land not south but Arcticwards; and Pierre himself,
      with Shon McGann and Just Trafford, had once had a strange experience in
      the Kimash Hills. He did not share the opinion of Lazenby, the Company&rsquo;s
      clerk at Fort Luke, who said, when the matter was talked of before him,
      that it was all hanky-panky,&mdash;which was evidence that he had lived in
      London town, before his anxious relatives, sending him forth under the
      delusive flag of adventure and wild life, imprisoned him in the Arctic
      regions with the H. B. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lazenby admired Pierre; said he was good stuff, and voted him amusing,
      with an ingenious emphasis of heathen oaths; but advised him, as only an
      insolent young scoundrel can, to forswear securing, by the seductive game
      of poker or euchre, larger interest on his capital than the H. B. C.;
      whose record, he insisted, should never be rivalled by any single man in
      any single lifetime. Then he incidentally remarked that he would like to
      empty the Company&rsquo;s cash-box once&mdash;only once;&mdash;thus reconciling
      the preacher and the sinner, as many another has done. Lazenby&rsquo;s morals
      were not bad, however. He was simply fond of making them appear terrible;
      even when in London he was more idle than wicked. He gravely suggested at
      last, as a kind of climax, that he and Pierre should go out on the pad
      together. This was a mere stroke of pleasantry on his part, because, the
      most he could loot in that far North were furs and caches of buffalo meat;
      and a man&rsquo;s capacity and use for them were limited. Even Pierre&rsquo;s especial
      faculty and art seemed valueless so far Polewards; but he had his beat
      throughout the land, and he kept it like a perfect patrolman. He had not
      been at Fort Luke for years, and he would not be there again for more
      years; but it was certain that he would go on reappearing till he vanished
      utterly. At the end of the first week of this visit at Fort Luke, so
      completely had he conquered the place, that he had won from the Chief
      Factor the year&rsquo;s purchases of skins, the stores, and the Fort itself; and
      every stitch of clothing owned by Lazenby: so that, if he had insisted on
      the redemption of the debts, the H. B. C. and Lazenby had been naked and
      hungry in the wilderness. But Pierre was not a hard creditor. He instantly
      and nonchalantly said that the Fort would be useless to him, and handed it
      back again with all therein, on a most humorously constructed ninety-nine
      years&rsquo; lease; while Lazenby was left in pawn. Yet Lazenby&rsquo;s mind was not
      at certain ease; he had a wholesome respect for Pierre&rsquo;s singularities,
      and dreaded being suddenly called upon to pay his debt before he could get
      his new clothes made, maybe, in the presence of Wind Driver, chief of the
      Golden Dogs, and his demure and charming daughter, Wine Face, who looked
      upon him with the eye of affection&mdash;a matter fully, but not
      ostentatiously, appreciated by Lazenby. If he could have entirely
      forgotten a pretty girl in South Kensington, who, at her parents&rsquo; bidding,
      turned her shoulder on him, he would have married Wine Face; and so he
      told Pierre. But the half-breed had only a sardonic sympathy for such
      weakness. Things changed at once when Shon McGann arrived. He should have
      come before, according to a promise given Pierre, but there were reasons
      for the delay; and these Shon elaborated in his finely picturesque style.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he had lost his way after he left the Wapiti Woods, and
      should never have found it again, had it not been for a strange being who
      came upon him and took him to the camp of the White Hand Indians, and
      cared for him there, and sent him safely on his way again to Fort Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra wan did I ever see like him,&rdquo; said Shon, &ldquo;with a face that was
      divil this minute and saint the next; pale in the cheek, and black in the
      eye, and grizzled hair flowin&rsquo; long at his neck and lyin&rsquo; like snakes on
      his shoulders; and whin his fingers closed on yours, bedad! they didn&rsquo;t
      seem human at all, for they clamped you so cold and strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For they clamped you so cold and strong,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Pierre, mockingly,
      yet greatly interested, as one could see by the upward range of his eye
      towards Shon. &ldquo;Well, what more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, squeeze the acid from y&rsquo;r voice, Pierre; for there&rsquo;s things that
      better become you: and listen to me, for I&rsquo;ve news for all here at the
      Fort, before I&rsquo;ve done, which&rsquo;ll open y&rsquo;r eyes with a jerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a wonderful jerk, hold! let us prepare, messieurs, to be waked with
      an Irish jerk!&rdquo; and Pierre pensively trifled with the fringe on Shon&rsquo;s
      buckskin jacket, which was whisked from his fingers with smothered anger.
      For a few moments he was silent; but the eager looks of the Chief Factor
      and Lazenby encouraged him to continue. Besides, it was only Pierre&rsquo;s way&mdash;provoking
      Shon was the piquant sauce of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lyin&rsquo; awake I was,&rdquo; continued Shon, &ldquo;in the middle of the night, not
      bein&rsquo; able to sleep for a pain in a shoulder I&rsquo;d strained, whin I heard a
      thing that drew me up standin&rsquo;. It was the sound of a child laughin&rsquo;; so
      wonderful and bright, and at the very door of me tent it seemed. Then it
      faded away till it was only a breath, lovely, and idle, and swingin&rsquo;. I
      wint to the door and looked out. There was nothin&rsquo; there, av coorse.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
      why &lsquo;av coorse&rsquo;&rdquo;? rejoined Pierre. The Chief Factor was intent on what
      Shon was saying, while Lazenby drummed his fingers on the table, his nose
      in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divils me darlin&rsquo;, but ye know as well as I, that there&rsquo;s things in the
      world neither for havin&rsquo; nor handlin&rsquo;. And that&rsquo;s wan of thim, says I to
      meself.... I wint back and lay down, and I heard the voice singin&rsquo; now and
      comin&rsquo; nearer and nearer, and growin&rsquo; louder and louder, and then there
      came with it a patter of feet, till it was as a thousand children were
      dancin&rsquo; by me door. I was shy enough, I&rsquo;ll own; but I pulled aside the
      curtain of the tent to see again: and there was nothin&rsquo; beyand for the
      eye. But the singin&rsquo; was goin&rsquo; past and recedin&rsquo; as before, till it died
      away along the waves of prairie grass. I wint back and give Grey Nose, my
      Injin bed-fellow, a lift wid me fut. &lsquo;Come out of that,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and tell
      me if dead or alive I am.&rsquo; He got up, and there was the noise soft and
      grand again, but with it now the voices of men, the flip of birds&rsquo; wings
      and the sighin&rsquo; of tree tops, and behind all that the long wash of a sea
      like none I ever heard.... &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I to the Injin grinnin&rsquo; before me,
      &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that, in the name o&rsquo; Moses?&rsquo; &lsquo;That,&rsquo; says he, laughin&rsquo; slow in me
      face, &lsquo;is the Tall Master&mdash;him that brought you to the camp.&rsquo; Thin I
      remimbered all the things that&rsquo;s been said of him, and I knew it was music
      I&rsquo;d been hearin&rsquo; and not children&rsquo;s voices nor anythin&rsquo; else at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come with me,&rsquo; says Grey Nose; and he took me to the door of a big tent
      standin&rsquo; alone from the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; says he, and he put his hand on the tent curtain; and at
      that there was a crash, as a million gold hammers were fallin&rsquo; on silver
      drums. And we both stood still; for it seemed an army, with swords
      wranglin&rsquo; and bridle-chains rattlin&rsquo;, was marchin&rsquo; down on us. There was
      the divil&rsquo;s own uproar, as a battle was comin&rsquo; on; and a long line of
      spears clashed. But just then there whistled through the larrup of sound a
      clear voice callin&rsquo;, gentle and coaxin&rsquo;, yet commandin&rsquo; too; and the
      spears dropped, and the pounding of horsehoofs ceased, and then the army
      marched away; far away; iver so far away, into&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into Heaven!&rdquo; flippantly interjected Lazenby. &ldquo;Into Heaven, say I, and be
      choked to you! for there&rsquo;s no other place for it; and I&rsquo;ll stand by that,
      till I go there myself, and know the truth o&rsquo; the thing.&rdquo; Pierre here
      spoke. &ldquo;Heaven gave you a fine trick with words, Shon McGann. I sometimes
      think Irishmen have gifts for only two things&mdash;words and women. ...
      &lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon was determined not to be angered. The occasion was too big. &ldquo;Well,
      Grey Nose lifted the curtain and wint in. In a minute he comes out. &lsquo;You
      can go in,&rsquo; says he. So in I wint, the Injin not comin&rsquo;, and there in the
      middle of the tint stood the Tall Master, alone. He had his fiddle to his
      chin, and the bow hoverin&rsquo; above it. He looked at me for a long time along
      the thing; then, all at once, from one string I heard the child laughin&rsquo; 
      that pleasant and distant, though the bow seemed not to be touchin&rsquo;. Soon
      it thinned till it was the shadow of a laugh, and I didn&rsquo;t know whin it
      stopped, he smilin&rsquo; down at the fiddle bewhiles. Then he said without
      lookin&rsquo; at me,&mdash;&lsquo;It is the spirit of the White Valley and the Hills
      of the Mighty Men; of which all men shall know, for the North will come to
      her spring again one day soon, at the remaking of the world. They thought
      the song would never be found again, but I have given it a home here.&rsquo; And
      he bent and kissed the strings. After, he turned sharply as if he&rsquo;d been
      spoken to, and looked at someone beside him; someone that I couldn&rsquo;t see.
      A cloud dropped upon his face, he caught the fiddle hungrily to his
      breast, and came limpin&rsquo; over to me&mdash;for there was somethin&rsquo; wrong
      with his fut&mdash;and lookin&rsquo; down his hook-nose at me, says he,&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      a word for them at Fort Luke, where you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;d better be gone
      at once; and I&rsquo;ll put you on your way. There&rsquo;s to be a great battle. The
      White Hands have an ancient feud with the Golden Dogs, and they have come
      from where the soft Chinook wind ranges the Peace River, to fight until no
      man of all the Golden Dogs be left, or till they themselves be destroyed.
      It is the same north and south,&rsquo; he wint on; &lsquo;I have seen it all in Italy,
      in Greece, in&mdash;&rsquo; but here he stopped and smiled strangely. After a
      minute he wint on: &lsquo;The White Hands have no quarrel with the Englishmen of
      the Fort, and I would warn them, for Englishmen were once kind to me&mdash;and
      warn also the Golden Dogs. So come with me at once,&rsquo; says he. And I did.
      And he walked with me till mornin&rsquo;, carryin&rsquo; the fiddle under his arm, but
      wrapped in a beautiful velvet cloth, havin&rsquo; on it grand figures like the
      arms of a king or queen. And just at the first whisk of sun he turned me
      into a trail and give me good-bye, sayin&rsquo; that maybe he&rsquo;d follow me soon,
      and, at any rate, he&rsquo;d be there at the battle. Well, divils betide me! I
      got off the track again; and lost a day; but here I am; and there&rsquo;s me
      story to take or lave as you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon paused and began to fumble with the cards on the table before him,
      looking the while at the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Factor was the first to speak. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt but he told you
      true about the White Hands and the Golden Dogs,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s
      been war and bad blood between them beyond the memory of man&mdash;at
      least since the time that the Mighty Men lived, from which these date
      their history. But there&rsquo;s nothing to be done to-night; for if we tell old
      Wind Driver, there&rsquo;ll be no sleeping at the Fort. So we&rsquo;ll let the thing
      stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe all this poppy-cock, Chief&rdquo;? said Lazenby to the Factor, but
      laughing in Shon&rsquo;s face the while. The Factor gravely replied: &ldquo;I knew of
      the Tall Master years ago on the Far-Off Metal River; and though I never
      saw him I can believe these things&mdash;and more. You do not know this
      world through and through, Lazenby; you have much to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre said nothing. He took the cards from Shon and passed them to and
      fro in his hand. Mechanically he dealt them out, and as mechanically they
      took them up and in silence began to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day there was commotion and excitement at Fort Luke. The Golden
      Dogs were making preparations for the battle. Pow-wow followed pow-wow,
      and paint and feathers followed all. The H. B. C. people had little to do
      but look to their guns and house everything within the walls of the Fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, Shon, Pierre, and Lazenby were seated about the table in the
      common-room, the cards lying dealt before them, waiting for the Factor to
      come. Presently the door opened and the Factor entered, followed by
      another. Shon and Pierre sprang to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tall Master,&rdquo; said Shon with a kind of awe; and then stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their towering visitor slowly unloosed something he carried very carefully
      and closely beneath his arm, and laid it on the table, dropping his
      compass-like fingers softly on it. He bowed gravely to each, yet the bow
      seemed grotesque, his body was so ungainly. With the eyes of all drawn to
      him absolutely, he spoke in a low sonorous tone: &ldquo;I have followed the
      traveller fast&rdquo;&mdash;his hand lifted gently towards Shon&mdash;&ldquo;for there
      are weighty concerns abroad, and I have things to say and do before I go
      again to my people&mdash;and beyond.... I have hungered for the face of a
      white man these many years, and his was the first I saw;&rdquo;&mdash;again he
      tossed a long finger towards the Irishman&mdash;&ldquo;and it brought back many
      things. I remember... &ldquo; He paused, then sat down; and they all did the
      same. He looked at them one by one with distant kindness. &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; he
      continued, and his strangely articulated fingers folded about the thing on
      the table beside him, &ldquo;when&rdquo;&mdash;here the cards caught his eye. His face
      underwent a change. An eager fantastic look shot from his eye, &ldquo;when I
      gambled this away at Lucca,&rdquo;&mdash;his hand drew the bundle closer to him&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I won it back again&mdash;at a price!&rdquo; he gloomily added, glancing
      sideways as to someone at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained, eyes hanging upon space for a moment, then he recollected
      himself and continued: &ldquo;I became wiser; I never risked it again; but I
      loved the game always. I was a gamester from the start&mdash;the artist is
      always so when he is greatest,&mdash;like nature herself. And once, years
      after, I played with a mother for her child&mdash;and mine. And yet once
      again at Parma with&rdquo;&mdash;here he paused, throwing that sharp sidelong
      glance&mdash;&ldquo;with the greatest gamester, for the infinite secret of Art:
      and I won it; but I paid the price!... I should like to play now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached his hand, drew up five cards, and ran his eye through them.
      &ldquo;Play!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The hand is good&mdash;very good.... Once when I played
      with the Princess&mdash;but it is no matter; and Tuscany is far away!...
      Play!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre instantly picked up the cards, with an air of cool satisfaction. He
      had either found the perfect gamester or the perfect liar. He knew the
      remedy for either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Factor did not move. Shon and Lazenby followed Pierre&rsquo;s action.
      By their positions Lazenby became his partner. They played in silence for
      a minute, the Tall Master taking all. &ldquo;Napoleon was a wonderful player,
      but he lost with me,&rdquo; he said slowly as he played a card upon three others
      and took them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lazenby was so taken back by this remark that, presently, he trumped his
      partner&rsquo;s ace, and was rewarded by a talon-like look from the Tall
      Master&rsquo;s eye; but it was immediately followed by one of saturnine
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played on silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are a wonderful player!&rdquo; he presently said to Pierre, with a look
      of keen scrutiny. &ldquo;Come, I will play with you&mdash;for values&mdash;the
      first time in seventy-five years; then, no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lazenby and Shon drew away beside the Chief Factor. The two played.
      Meanwhile Lazenby said to Shon: &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s mad. He talks about Napoleon as
      if he&rsquo;d known him&mdash;as if it wasn&rsquo;t three-fourths of a century ago.
      Does he think we&rsquo;re all born idiots? Why, he&rsquo;s not over sixty years old
      now. But where the deuce did he come from with that Italian face? And the
      funniest part of it is, he reminds me of someone. Did you notice how he
      limped&mdash;the awkward beggar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lazenby had unconsciously lifted his voice, and presently the Tall Master
      turned and said to him: &ldquo;I ran a nail into my foot at Leyden seventy-odd
      years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the devil himself,&rdquo; rejoined Lazenby, and he did not lower his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many with angelic gifts are children of His Dark Majesty,&rdquo; said the Tall
      Master, slowly; and though he appeared closely occupied with the game, a
      look of vague sadness came into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a half-hour they played in silence, the slight, delicate-featured
      half-breed, and the mysterious man who had for so long been a thing of
      wonder in the North, a weird influence among the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange, cold fierceness in the Tall Master&rsquo;s face. He now
      staked his precious bundle against the one thing Pierre prized&mdash;the
      gold watch received years ago for a deed of heroism on the Chaudiere. The
      half-breed had always spoken of it as amusing, but Shon at least knew that
      to Pierre it was worth his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men drew breath slowly, and their eyes were hard. The stillness
      became painful; all were possessed by the grim spirit of Chance.... The
      Tall Master won. He came to his feet, his shambling body drawn together to
      a height. Pierre rose also. Their looks clinched. Pierre stretched out his
      hand. &ldquo;You are my master at this,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled sadly. &ldquo;I have played for the last time. I have not
      forgotten how to win. If I had lost, uncommon things had happened. This,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      laid his hand on the bundle and gently undid it,&mdash;&ldquo;is my oldest
      friend, since the warm days at Parma... all dead... all dead.&rdquo; Out of the
      velvet wrapping, broidered with royal and ducal arms, and rounded by a
      wreath of violets&mdash;which the Chief Factor looked at closely&mdash;he
      drew his violin. He lifted it reverently to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Garnerius!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Three masters played you, but I am chief of
      them all. They had the classic soul, but I the romantic heart&mdash;&lsquo;les
      grandes caprices.&rsquo;&rdquo; His head lifted higher. &ldquo;I am the master artist of the
      world. I have found the core of Nature. Here in the North is the wonderful
      soul of things. Beyond this, far beyond, where the foolish think is only
      inviolate ice, is the first song of the Ages in a very pleasant land. I am
      the lost Master, and I shall return, I shall return ... but not yet... not
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fetched the instrument to his chin with a noble pride. The ugliness of
      his face was almost beautiful now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Factor&rsquo;s look was fastened on him with bewilderment; he was
      trying to remember something: his mind went feeling, he knew not why, for
      a certain day, a quarter of a century before, when he unpacked a box of
      books and papers from England. Most of them were still in the Fort. The
      association of this man with these things fretted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tall Master swung his bow upward, but at that instant there came a
      knock, and, in response to a call, Wind Driver and Wine Face entered. Wine
      Face was certainly a beautiful girl; and Lazenby might well have been
      pardoned for throwing in his fate with such a heathen, if he despaired of
      ever seeing England again. The Tall Master did not turn towards these. The
      Indians sat gracefully on a bearskin before the fire. The eyes of the girl
      were cast shyly upon the Man as he stood there unlike an ordinary man; in
      his face a fine hardness and the cold light of the North. He suddenly
      tipped his bow upward and brought it down with a most delicate crash upon
      the strings. Then softly, slowly, he passed into a weird fantasy. The
      Indians sat breathless. Upon them it acted more impressively than the
      others: besides, the player&rsquo;s eye was searching them now; he was playing
      into their very bodies. And they responded with some swift shocks of
      recognition crossing their faces. Suddenly the old Indian sprang up. He
      thrust his arms out, and made, as if unconsciously, some fantastic yet
      solemn motions. The player smiled in a far-off fashion, and presently ran
      the bow upon the strings in an exquisite cry; and then a beautiful
      avalanche of sound slid from a distance, growing nearer and nearer, till
      it swept through the room, and imbedded all in its sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the old Indian threw himself forward at the player&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;It is
      the song of the White Weaver, the maker of the world&mdash;the music from
      the Hills of the Mighty Men.... I knew it&mdash;I knew it&mdash;but never
      like that. ... It was lost to the world; the wild cry of the lofty
      stars....&rdquo; His face was wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl too had risen. She came forward as if in a dream and reverently
      touched the arm of the musician, who paused now, and was looking at them
      from under his long eyelashes. She said whisperingly: &ldquo;Are you a spirit?
      Do you come from the Hills of the Mighty Men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered gravely: &ldquo;I am no spirit. But I have journeyed in the Hills of
      the Mighty Men and along their ancient hunting-grounds. This that I have
      played is the ancient music of the world&mdash;the music of Jubal and his
      comrades. It comes humming from the Poles; it rides laughing down the
      planets; it trembles through the snow; it gives joy to the bones of the
      wind.... And I am the voice of it,&rdquo; he added; and he drew up his loose
      unmanageable body till it looked enormous, firm, and dominant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s fingers ran softly over to his breast. &ldquo;I will follow you,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;when you go again to the Happy Valleys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down from his brow there swept a faint hue of colour, and, for a breath,
      his eyes closed tenderly with hers. But he straightway gathered back his
      look again, his body shrank, not rudely, from her fingers, and he absently
      said: &ldquo;I am old-in years the father of the world. It is a man&rsquo;s life gone
      since, at Genoa, she laid her fingers on my breast like that. ... These
      things can be no more... until the North hath its summer again; and I
      stand young&mdash;the Master&mdash;upon the summits of my renown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew slowly back. Lazenby was muttering under his breath now; he
      was overwhelmed by this change in Wine Face. He had been impressed to awe
      by the Tall Master&rsquo;s music, but he was piqued, and determined not to give
      in easily. He said sneeringly that Maskelyne and Cooke in music had come
      to life, and suggested a snake-dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tall Master heard these things, and immediately he turned to Lazenby
      with an angry look on his face. His brows hung heavily over the dull fire
      of his eyes; his hair itself seemed like Medusa&rsquo;s, just quivering into
      savage life; the fingers spread out white and claw-like upon the strings
      as he curved his violin to his chin, whereof it became, as it were, a
      piece. The bow shot out and down upon the instrument with a great
      clangour. There eddied into a vast arena of sound the prodigious elements
      of war. Torture rose from those four immeasurable chords; destruction was
      afoot upon them; a dreadful dance of death supervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the Chief Factor&rsquo;s mind there flashed&mdash;though mechanically,
      and only to be remembered afterwards&mdash;the words of a schoolday poem.
      It shuttled in and out of the music:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Wheel the wild dance,
          While lightnings glance,
          And thunders rattle loud;
          And call the brave to bloody grave,
          To sleep without a shroud.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The face of the player grew old and drawn. The skin was wrinkled, but
      shone, the hair spread white, the nose almost met the chin, the mouth was
      all malice. It was old age with vast power: conquest volleyed from the
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon McGann whispered aves, aching with the sound; the Chief Factor
      shuddered to his feet; Lazenby winced and drew back to the wall, putting
      his hand before his face as though the sounds were striking him; the old
      Indian covered his head with his arms upon the floor. Wine Face knelt, her
      face all grey, her fingers lacing and interlacing with pain. Only Pierre
      sat with masterful stillness, his eyes never moving from the face of the
      player; his arms folded; his feet firmly wedded to the floor. The sound
      became strangely distressing. It shocked the flesh and angered the nerves.
      Upon Lazenby it acted singularly. He cowered from it, but presently, with
      a look of madness in his eyes, rushed forward, arms outstretched, as
      though to seize this intolerable minstrel. There was a sudden pause in the
      playing; then the room quaked with noise, buffeting Lazenby into
      stillness. The sounds changed instantly again, and music of an engaging
      sweetness and delight fell about them as in silver drops&mdash;an
      enchanting lyric of love. Its exquisite tenderness subdued Lazenby, who,
      but now, had a heart for slaughter. He dropped on his knees, threw his
      head into his arms, and sobbed hard. The Tall Master&rsquo;s fingers crept
      caressingly along one of those heavenly veins of sound, his bow poising
      softly over it. The farthest star seemed singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn the next day the Golden Dogs were gathered for war before the
      Fort. Immediately after the sun rose, the foe were seen gliding darkly out
      of the horizon. From another direction came two travellers. These also saw
      the White Hands bearing upon the Fort, and hurried forward. They reached
      the gates of the Fort in good time, and were welcomed. One was a chief
      trader from a fort in the west. He was an old man, and had been many years
      in the service of the H. B. C.; and, like Lazenby, had spent his early
      days in London, a connoisseur in all its pleasures; the other was a
      voyageur. They had posted on quickly to bring news of this crusade of the
      White Hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostile Indians came steadily to within a few hundred yards of the
      Golden Dogs. Then they sent a brave to say that they had no quarrel with
      the people of the Fort; and that if the Golden Dogs came on they would
      battle with them alone; since the time had come for &ldquo;one to be as both,&rdquo;
       as their Medicine Men had declared since the days of the Great Race. And
      this signified that one should destroy the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this all the Golden Dogs ranged into line. The sun shone brightly, the
      long hedge of pine woods in the distance caught the colour of the sky, the
      flowers of the plains showed handsomely as a carpet of war. The bodies of
      the fighters glistened. You could see the rise and fall of their bare,
      strenuous chests. They stood as their forefathers in battle, almost naked,
      with crested head, gleaming axe, scalp-knife, and bows and arrows. At
      first there was the threatening rustle of preparation; then a great
      stillness came and stayed for a moment; after which, all at once, there
      sped through the air a big shout of battle, and the innumerable twang of
      flying arrows; and the opposing hosts ran upon each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre and Shon McGann, watching from the Fort, cried out with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divils me darlin&rsquo;!&rdquo; called Shon, &ldquo;are we gluin&rsquo; our eyes to a chink in
      the wall, whin the tangle of battle goes on beyand? Bedad, I&rsquo;ll not stand
      it! Look at them twistin&rsquo; the neck o&rsquo; war! Open the gates, open the gates
      say I, and let us have play with our guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! &lsquo;Mon Dieu!&rsquo;&rdquo; interrupted Pierre. &ldquo;Look! The Tall Master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None at the Fort had seen the Tall Master since the night before. Now he
      was covering the space between the walls and the battle, his hair
      streaming behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came near to the vortex of fight he raised his violin to his chin,
      and instantly a piercingly sweet call penetrated the wild uproar. The Call
      filled it, drained through it, wrapped it, overcame it; so that it sank
      away at last like the outwash of an exhausted tide: the weft of battle
      stayed unfinished in the loom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from the Indian lodges came the women and children. They drew near to
      the unearthly luxury of that Call, now lifting with an unbounded joy.
      Battleaxes fell to the ground; the warriors quieted even where they stood
      locked with their foes. The Tall Master now drew away from them, facing
      the north and west. That ineffable Call drew them after him with grave
      joy; and they brought their dead and wounded along. The women and children
      glided in among the men and followed also. Presently one girl ran away
      from the rest and came close into the great leader&rsquo;s footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant, Lazenby, from the wall of the Fort, cried out madly,
      sprang down, opened the gates, and rushed towards the girl, crying: &ldquo;Wine
      Face! Wine Face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look behind. But he came close to her and caught her by the
      waist. &ldquo;Come back! Come back! O my love, come back!&rdquo; he urged; but she
      pushed him gently from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are going to the Happy Valleys. Don&rsquo;t you hear
      him calling&rdquo;?... And Lazenby fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tall Master was now playing a wonderful thing, half dance, half
      carnival; but with that Call still beating through it. They were passing
      the Fort at an angle. All within issued forth to see. Suddenly the old
      trader who had come that morning started forward with a cry; then stood
      still. He caught the Factor&rsquo;s arm; but he seemed unable to speak yet; his
      face was troubled, his eyes were hard upon the player.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession passed the empty lodges, leaving the ground strewn with
      their weapons, and not one of their number stayed behind. They passed away
      towards the high hills of the north-west-beautiful austere barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the trader gazed, and was pale, and trembled. They watched long. The
      throng of pilgrims grew a vague mass; no longer an army of individuals;
      and the music came floating back with distant charm. At last the old man
      found voice. &ldquo;My God, it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Factor touched his arm, interrupting him, and drew a picture from his
      pocket&mdash;one but just now taken from that musty pile of books,
      received so many years before. He showed it to the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that is he.... And the world buried him forty
      years ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, standing near, added with soft irony: &ldquo;There are strange things in
      the world. He is the gamester of the world. &lsquo;Mais&rsquo; a grand comrade also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music came waving back upon them delicately but the pilgrims were
      fading from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the watchers were alone with the glowing day.

    <h2>
      THE CRIMSON FLAG
    </h2>
    <p>
      Talk and think as one would, The Woman was striking to see; with
      marvellous flaxen hair and a joyous violet eye. She was all pulse and
      dash; but she was as much less beautiful than the manager&rsquo;s wife as Tom
      Liffey was as nothing beside the manager himself; and one would care
      little to name the two women in the same breath if the end had been
      different. When The Woman came to Little Goshen there were others of her
      class there, but they were of a commoner sort and degree. She was the
      queen of a lawless court, though she never, from first to last, spoke to
      one of those others who were her people; neither did she hold commerce
      with any of the ordinary miners, save Pretty Pierre, but he was more
      gambler than miner,&mdash;and he went, when the matter was all over, and
      told her some things that stripped her soul naked before her eyes. Pierre
      had a wonderful tongue. It was only the gentlemen-diggers&mdash;and there
      were many of them at Little Goshen&mdash;who called upon her when the
      lights were low; and then there was a good deal of muffled mirth in the
      white house among the pines. The rougher miners made no quarrel with this,
      for the gentlemen-diggers were popular enough, they were merely sarcastic
      and humorous, and said things which, coming to The Woman&rsquo;s ears, made her
      very merry; for she herself had an abundant wit, and had spent wild hours
      with clever men. She did not resent the playful insolence that sent a
      dozen miners to her house in the dead of night with a crimson flag, which
      they quietly screwed to her roof; and paint, with which they deftly put a
      wide stripe of scarlet round the cornice, and another round the basement.
      In the morning, when she saw what had been done, she would not have the
      paint removed nor the flag taken down; for, she said, the stripes looked
      very well, and the other would show that she was always at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the notable thing was that Heldon, the manager, was in The Woman&rsquo;s
      house on the night this was done. Tom Liffey, the lumpish guide and
      trapper, saw him go in; and, days afterwards, he said to Pierre: &ldquo;Divils
      me own, but this is a bad hour for Heldon&rsquo;s wife&mdash;she with a face
      like a princess and eyes like the fear o&rsquo; God. Nivir a wan did I see like
      her, since I came out of Erin with a clatter of hoofs behoind me and a
      squall on the sea before. There&rsquo;s wimmin there wid cheeks like roses and
      buthermilk, and a touch that&rsquo;d make y&rsquo;r heart pound on y&rsquo;r ribs; but none
      that&rsquo;s grander than Heldon&rsquo;s wife. To lave her for that other, standin&rsquo; 
      hip-high in her shame, is temptin&rsquo; the fires of Heaven, that basted the
      sinners o&rsquo; Sodom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, pausing between the whiffs of a cigarette, said: &ldquo;So? But you know
      more of catching foxes in winter, and climbing mountains in summer, and
      the grip of the arm of an Injin girl, than of these things. You are young,
      quite young in the world, Tom Liffey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young I may be with a glint o&rsquo; grey at me temples from a night o&rsquo; trouble
      beyand in the hills; but I&rsquo;m the man, an&rsquo; the only man, that&rsquo;s climbed to
      the glacier-top&mdash;God&rsquo;s Playground, as they call it: and nivir a dirty
      trick have I done to Injin girl or any other; and be damned to you there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think you are as foolish as Shon McGann,&rdquo; compassionately
      replied the half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have almighty virtue, and you did that brave trick of the glacier;
      but great men have fallen. You are not dead yet. Still, as you say,
      Heldon&rsquo;s wife is noble to see. She is grave and cold, and speaks little;
      but there is something in her which is not of the meek of the earth. Some
      women say nothing, and suffer and forgive, and take such as Heldon back to
      their bosoms; but there are others&mdash;I remember a woman&mdash;bien, it
      is no matter, it was long ago; but they two are as if born of one mother;
      and what comes of this will be mad play&mdash;mad play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Av coorse his wife may not get to know of it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not get to know it! &lsquo;Tsh, you are a child&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll say what I think, and that in y&rsquo;r face! Maybe he&rsquo;ll tire of
      the handsome rip&mdash;for handsome she is, like a yellow lily growin&rsquo; out
      o&rsquo; mud&mdash;and go back to his lawful wife, that believes he&rsquo;s at the
      mines, when he&rsquo;s drinkin&rsquo; and colloguin&rsquo; wid a fly-away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre slowly wheeled till he had the Irishman straight in his eye. Then
      he said in a low, cutting tone: &ldquo;I suppose your heart aches for the
      beautiful lady, eh?&rdquo; Here he screwed his slight forefinger into Tom&rsquo;s
      breast; then he added sharply: &ldquo;&lsquo;Nom de Dieu,&rsquo; but you make me angry! You
      talk too much. Such men get into trouble. And keep down the riot of that
      heart of yours, Tom Liffey, or you&rsquo;ll walk on the edge of knives one day.
      And now take an inch of whisky and ease the anxious soul. &lsquo;Voila!&rsquo;&rdquo; After
      a moment he added: &ldquo;Women work these things out for themselves.&rdquo; Then the
      two left the hut, and amiably strolled together to the centre of the
      village, where they parted. It was as Pierre had said: the woman would
      work the thing out for herself. Later that evening Heldon&rsquo;s wife stood
      cloaked and veiled in the shadows of the pines, facing the house with The
      Crimson Flag. Her eyes shifted ever from the door to the flag, which was
      stirred by the light breeze. Once or twice she shivered as with cold, but
      she instantly stilled again, and watched. It was midnight. Here and there
      beyond in the village a light showed, and straggling voices floated
      faintly towards her. For a long time no sound came from the house. But at
      last she heard a laugh. At that she drew something from her pocket, and
      held it firmly in her hand. Once she turned and looked at another house
      far up on the hill, where lights were burning. It was Heldon&rsquo;s house&mdash;her
      home. A sharp sound as of anguish and anger escaped her; then she fastened
      her eyes on the door in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Tom Liffey was standing with his hands on his hips looking
      at Heldon&rsquo;s home on the hill; and he said some rumbling words, then strode
      on down the road, and suddenly paused near the wife. He did not see her.
      He faced the door at which she was looking, and shook his fist at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A murrain on y&rsquo;r sowl!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as there&rsquo;s plague in y&rsquo;r body, and hell
      in the slide of y&rsquo;r feet, like the trail of the red spider. And out o&rsquo; 
      that come ye, Heldon, for I know y&rsquo;re there. Out of that, ye beast! ...
      But how can ye go back&mdash;you that&rsquo;s rolled in that sewer&mdash;to the
      loveliest woman that ever trod the neck o&rsquo; the world! Damned y&rsquo; are in
      every joint o&rsquo; y&rsquo;r frame, and damned is y&rsquo;r sowl, I say, for bringing
      sorrow to her; and I hate you as much for that, as I could worship her was
      she not your wife and a lady o&rsquo; blood, God save her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then shaking his fist once more, he swung away slowly down the road.
      During this the wife&rsquo;s teeth held together as though they were of a piece.
      She looked after Tom Liffey and smiled; but it was a dreadful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He worships me, that common man&mdash;worships me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This man
      who was my husband has shamed me, left me. Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the house opened; a man came out. His wife leaned a little
      forward, and something clicked ominously in her hand. But a voice came up
      the road towards them through the clear air&mdash;the voice of Tom Liffey.
      The husband paused to listen; the wife mechanically did the same. The
      husband remembered this afterwards: it was the key to, and the beginning
      of, a tragedy. These are the words the Irishman sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;She was a queen, she stood up there before me,
        My blood went roarin&rsquo; when she touched my hand;
        She kissed me on the lips, and then she swore me
        To die for her&mdash;and happy was the land.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A new and singular look came into her face. It trans formed her. &ldquo;That,&rdquo;
       she said in a whisper to herself&mdash;&ldquo;that! He knows the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As her husband turned towards his home, she turned also. He heard the
      rustle of garments, and he could just discern the cloaked figure in the
      shadows. He hurried on; the figure flitted ahead of him. A fear possessed
      him in spite of his will. He turned back. The figure stood still for a
      moment, then followed him. He braced himself, faced about, and walked
      towards it: it stopped and waited. He had not the courage. He went back
      again swiftly towards the house he had left. Again he looked behind him.
      The figure was standing, not far, in the pines. He wheeled suddenly
      towards the house, turned a key in the door, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wife went to that which had been her home: Heldon did not go
      thither until the first flush of morning. Pierre, returning from an
      all-night sitting at cards, met him, and saw the careworn look on his
      face. The half-breed smiled. He knew that the event was doubling on the
      man. When Heldon reached his house, he went to his wife&rsquo;s room. It was
      locked. Then he walked down to his mines with a miserable shame and anger
      at his heart. He did not pass The Crimson Flag. He went by another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, in the dusk, a woman knocked at Tom Liffey&rsquo;s door. He opened
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you alone&rdquo;? she said. &ldquo;I am alone, lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come in,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You will&mdash;come in&rdquo;? he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew near him, and reached out and gently caught his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, with a sound almost like a sob in its intensity, and the
      blood flushed to his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped aside, and she entered. In the light of the candle her eye
      burned into his, but her face wore a shining coldness. She leaned towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you could worship me,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and you cursed him. Well&mdash;worship
      me&mdash;altogether&mdash;and that will curse him, as he has killed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady!&rdquo; he said, in an awed, overwhelmed murmur; and he fell back to
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came towards him. &ldquo;Am I not beautiful&rdquo;? she urged. She took his hand.
      His eye swam with hers. But his look was different from hers, though he
      could not know that. His was the madness of a man in a dream; hers was a
      painful thing. The Furies dwelt in her. She softly lifted his hand above
      his head, and whispered: &ldquo;Swear.&rdquo; And she kissed him. Her lips were icy,
      though he did not think so. The blood tossed in his veins. He swore: but,
      doing so, he could not conceive all that would be required of him. He was
      hers, body and soul, and she had resolved on a grim thing.... In the
      darkness, they left the hut and passed into the woods, and slowly up
      through the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heldon returned to his home that night to find it empty. There were no
      servants. There was no wife. Her cat and dog lay dead upon the hearthrug.
      Her clothing was cut into strips. Her wedding-dress was a charred heap on
      the fireplace. Her jewellery lay molten with it. Her portrait had been
      torn from its frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      An intolerable fear possessed him. Drops of sweat hung on his forehead and
      his hands. He fled towards the town. He bit his finger-nails till they
      bled as he passed the house in the pines. He lifted his arm as if the
      flappings of The Crimson Flag were blows in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he passed Tom Liffey&rsquo;s hut. He saw Pierre, coming from it. The
      look on the gambler&rsquo;s face was one, of gloomy wonder. His fingers trembled
      as he lighted a cigarette, and that was an unusual thing. The form of
      Heldon edged within the light. Pierre dropped the match and said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      are looking for your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heldon bowed his head. The other threw open the door of the hut. &ldquo;Come in
      here,&rdquo; he said. They entered. Pierre pointed to a woman&rsquo;s hat on the
      table. &ldquo;Do you know that&rdquo;? he asked, huskily, for he was moved. But Heldon
      only nodded dazedly. Pierre continued: &ldquo;I was to have met Tom Liffey here&mdash;to-night.
      He is not here. You hoped&mdash;I suppose&mdash;to see your wife in your&mdash;home.
      She is not there. He left a word on paper for me. I have torn it up.
      Writing is the enemy of man. But I know where he is gone. I know also
      where your wife has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heldon&rsquo;s face was of a hateful paleness.... They passed out into the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going&rdquo;? Heldon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To God&rsquo;s Playground, if we can get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To God&rsquo;s Playground? To the glacier-top? You are mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he and she were mad. Come on.&rdquo; Then he whispered something, and
      Heldon gave a great cry, and they plunged into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the people of Little Goshen, looking towards the glacier,
      saw a flag (they knew afterwards that it was crimson) flying on it. Near
      it were two human figures. A miner, looking through a field-glass, said
      that one figure was crouching by the flag-staff, and that it was a woman.
      The other figure near was a man. As the morning wore on, they saw upon a
      crag of ice below the sloping glacier two men looking upwards towards the
      flag. One of them seemed to shriek out, and threw up his hands, and made
      as if to rush forward; but the other drew him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heldon knew what revenge and disgrace may be at their worst. In vain he
      tried to reach God&rsquo;s Playground. Only one man knew the way, and he was
      dead upon it&mdash;with Heldon&rsquo;s wife: two shameless suicides.... When he
      came down from the mountain the hair upon his face was white, though that
      upon his head remained black as it had always been. And those frozen
      figures stayed there like statues with that other crimson flag: until, one
      day, a great-bodied wind swept out of the north, and, in pity, carried
      them down a bottomless fissure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But long before this happened, The Woman had fled from Little Goshen in
      the night, and her house was burned to the ground.

    <h2>
      THE FLOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wendling came to Fort Anne on the day that the Reverend Ezra Badgley and
      an unknown girl were buried. And that was a notable thing. The man had
      been found dead at his evening meal; the girl had died on the same day;
      and they were buried side by side. This caused much scandal, for the man
      was holy, and the girl, as many women said, was probably evil altogether.
      At the graves, when the minister&rsquo;s people saw what was being done, they
      piously protested; but the Factor, to whom Pierre had whispered a word,
      answered them gravely that the matter should go on: since none knew but
      the woman was as worthy of heaven as the man. Wendling chanced to stand
      beside Pretty Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows!&rdquo; he said aloud, looking hard at the graves, &ldquo;who knows!... She
      died before him, but the dead can strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre did not answer immediately, for the Factor was calling the earth
      down on both coffins; but after a moment he added: &ldquo;Yes, the dead can
      strike.&rdquo; And then the eyes of the two men caught and stayed, and they knew
      that they had things to say to each other in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      They became friends. And that, perhaps, was not greatly to Wendling&rsquo;s
      credit; for in the eyes of many Pierre was an outcast as an outlaw. Maybe
      some of the women disliked this friendship most; since Wendling was a
      handsome man, and Pierre was never known to seek them, good or bad; and
      they blamed him for the other&rsquo;s coldness, for his unconcerned yet
      respectful eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Nelly Nolan would dance after him to the world&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; said Shon
      McGann to Pierre one day; &ldquo;and the Widdy Jerome herself, wid her flamin&rsquo; 
      cheeks and the wild fun in her eye, croons like a babe at the breast as he
      slides out his cash on the bar; and over on Gansonby&rsquo;s Flat there&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a fool, &lsquo;voila,&rsquo;&rdquo; sharply interjected Pierre, as he pushed
      the needle through a button he was sewing on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, there&rsquo;s a pair of fools here, anyway, I say; for the women might
      die without lift at waist or brush of lip, and neither of ye&rsquo;d say,
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the joy of us, goddess, me own!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre seemed to be intently watching the needlepoint as it pierced up the
      button-eye, and his reply was given with a slowness corresponding to the
      sedate passage of the needle. &ldquo;Wendling, you think, cares nothing for
      women? Well, men who are like that cared once for one woman, and when that
      was over&mdash;But, pshaw! I will not talk. You are no thinker, Shon
      McGann. You blunder through the world. And you&rsquo;ll tremble as much to a
      woman&rsquo;s thumb in fifty years as now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the holy smoke,&rdquo; said Shon, &ldquo;though I tremble at that, maybe, I&rsquo;ll not
      tremble, as Wendling, at nothing at all.&rdquo; Here Pierre looked up sharply,
      then dropped his eyes on his work again. Shon lapsed suddenly into a
      moodiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pierre, &ldquo;as Wendling, at nothing at all? Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this, Pierre, for you that&rsquo;s a thinker from me that&rsquo;s none. I was
      walking with him in Red Glen yesterday. Sudden he took to shiverin&rsquo;, and
      snatched me by the arm, and a mad look shot out of his handsome face.
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; says he. I listened. There was a sound like the hard rattle of a
      creek over stones, and then another sound behind that. &lsquo;Come quick,&rsquo; says
      he, the sweat standin&rsquo; thick on him; and he ran me up the bank&mdash;for
      it was at the beginnin&rsquo; of the Glen where the sides were low&mdash;and
      there we stood pantin&rsquo; and starin&rsquo; flat at each other. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that? and
      what&rsquo;s got its hand on ye? for y&rsquo; are cold as death, an&rsquo; pinched in the
      face, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve bruised my arm,&rsquo; said I. And he looked round him slow and
      breathed hard, then drew his fingers through the sweat on his cheek. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      not well, and I thought I heard&mdash;you heard it; what was it like?&rsquo; 
      said he; and he peered close at me. &lsquo;Like water,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;a little creek
      near, and a flood comin&rsquo; far off.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, just that,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s some
      trick of wind in the place, but it makes a man foolish, and an inch of
      brandy would be the right thing.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t say no to that. And on we came,
      and brandy we had with a wish in the eye of Nelly Nolan that&rsquo;d warm the
      heart of a tomb.... And there&rsquo;s a cud for your chewin&rsquo;, Pierre. Think that
      by the neck and the tail, and the divil absolve ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this, Pierre had finished with the button. He had drawn on his coat
      and lifted his hat, and now lounged, trying the point of the needle with
      his forefinger. When Shon ended, he said with a sidelong glance: &ldquo;But what
      did you think of all that, Shon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think! There it was! What&rsquo;s the use of thinkin&rsquo;? There&rsquo;s many a trick in
      the world with wind or with spirit, as I&rsquo;ve seen often enough in ould
      Ireland, and it&rsquo;s not to be guessed by me.&rdquo; Here his voice got a little
      lower and a trifle solemn. &ldquo;For, Pierre,&rdquo; spoke he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s more
      than life or death, and sorra wan can we tell what it is; but we&rsquo;ll know
      some day whin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve taken the leap at the Almighty Ditch,&rdquo; said Pierre, with a
      grave kind of lightness. &ldquo;Yes, it is all strange. But even the Almighty
      Ditch is worth the doing: nearly everything is worth the doing; being
      young, growing old, fighting, loving&mdash;when youth is on&mdash;hating,
      eating, drinking, working, playing big games. All is worth it except two
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are they, bedad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife and murder. Those are horrible. They double on a man
      one time or another; always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, as in curiosity, Pierre pierced his finger with the needle, and
      watched the blood form in a little globule. Looking at it meditatively and
      sardonically, he said: &ldquo;There is only one end to these. Blood for blood is
      a great matter; and I used to wonder if it would not be terrible for a man
      to see his death coming on him drop by drop, like that.&rdquo; He let the spot
      of blood fall to the floor. &ldquo;But now I know that there is a punishment
      worse than that... &lsquo;mon Dieu!&rsquo; worse than that,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into Shon&rsquo;s face a strange look had suddenly come. &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s something
      worse than that, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, &lsquo;bien?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon made the sacred gesture of his creed. &ldquo;To be punished by the dead.
      And not see them&mdash;only hear them.&rdquo; And his eyes steadied firmly to
      the other&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was about to reply, but there came the sound of footsteps through
      the open door, and presently Wendling entered slowly. He was pale and
      worn, and his eyes looked out with a searching anxiousness. But that did
      not render him less comely. He had always dressed in black and white, and
      this now added to the easy and yet severe refinement of his person. His
      birth and breeding had occurred in places unfrequented by such as Shon and
      Pierre; but plains and wild life level all; and men are friends according
      to their taste and will, and by no other law. Hence these with Wendling.
      He stretched out his hand to each without a word. The hand-shake was
      unusual; he had little demonstration ever. Shon looked up surprised, but
      responded. Pierre followed with a swift, inquiring look; then, in the
      succeeding pause, he offered cigarettes. Wendling took one; and all,
      silent, sat down. The sun streamed intemperately through the doorway,
      making a broad ribbon of light straight across the floor to Wendling&rsquo;s
      feet. After lighting his cigarette, he looked into the sunlight for a
      moment, still not speaking. Shon meanwhile had started his pipe, and now,
      as if he found the silence awkward,&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a day for God&rsquo;s country,
      this,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;to make man a Christian for little or much, though he
      play with the Divil betunewhiles.&rdquo; Without looking at them, Wendling said,
      in a low voice: &ldquo;It was just such a day, down there in Quebec, when It
      happened. You could hear the swill of the river, the water licking the
      piers, and the saws in the Big Mill and the Little Mill as they marched
      through the timber, flashing their teeth like bayonets. It&rsquo;s a wonderful
      sound on a hot, clear day&mdash;that wild, keen singing of the saws, like
      the cry of a live thing fighting and conquering. Up from the fresh-cut
      lumber in the yards there came a smell like the juice of apples, and the
      sawdust, as you thrust your hand into it, was as cool and soft as the
      leaves of a clove-flower in the dew. On these days the town was always
      still. It looked sleeping, and you saw the heat quivering up from the
      wooden walls and the roofs of cedar shingles as though the houses were
      breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused, still intent on the shaking sunshine. Then he turned to
      the others as if suddenly aware that he had been talking to them. Shon was
      about to speak, but Pierre threw a restraining glance, and, instead, they
      all looked through the doorway and beyond. In the settlement below they
      saw the effect that Wendling had described. The houses breathed. A
      grasshopper went clacking past, a dog at the door snapped up a fly; but
      there seemed no other life of day. Wendling nodded his head towards the
      distance. &ldquo;It was quiet, like that. I stood and watched the mills and the
      yards, and listened to the saws, and looked at the great slide, and the
      logs on the river: and I said ever to myself that it was all mine&mdash;all.
      Then I turned to a big house on the hillock beyond the cedars, whose
      windows were open, with a cool dusk lying behind them. More than all else,
      I loved to think I owned that house and what was in it.... She was a
      beautiful woman. And she used to sit in a room facing the mill&mdash;though
      the house fronted another way&mdash;thinking of me, I did not doubt, and
      working at some delicate needle-stuff. There never had been a sharp word
      between us, save when I quarrelled bitterly with her brother, and he left
      the mill and went away. But she got over that mostly, though the lad&rsquo;s
      name was, never mentioned between us. That day I was so hungry for the
      sight of her that I got my field-glass&mdash;used to watch my vessels and
      rafts making across the bay&mdash;and trained it on the window where I
      knew she sat. I thought, it would amuse her, too, when I went back at
      night, if I told her what she had been doing. I laughed to myself at the
      thought of it as I adjusted the glass.... I looked.... There was no more
      laughing.... I saw her, and in front of her a man, with his back half on
      me. I could not recognise him, though at the instant I thought he was
      something familiar. I failed to get his face at all. Hers I found
      indistinctly. But I saw him catch her playfully by the chin! After a
      little they rose. He put his arm about her and kissed her, and he ran his
      fingers through her hair. She had such fine golden hair&mdash;so light,
      and it lifted to every breath. Something got into my brain. I know now it
      was the maggot which sent Othello mad. The world in that hour was
      malicious, awful....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a time&mdash;it seemed ages, she and everything had receded so far&mdash;I
      went... home. At the door I asked the servant who had been there. She
      hesitated, confused, and then said the young curate of the parish. I was
      very cool: for madness is a strange thing; you see everything with an
      intense aching clearness&mdash;that is the trouble.... She was more kind
      than common. I do not think I was unusual. I was playing a part well, my
      grandmother had Indian blood like yours, Pierre, and I was waiting. I was
      even nicely critical of her to myself. I balanced the mole on her neck
      against her general beauty; the curve of her instep, I decided, was a
      little too emphatic. I passed her backwards and forwards, weighing her at
      every point; but yet these two things were the only imperfections. I
      pronounced her an exceeding piece of art&mdash;and infamy. I was much
      interested to see how she could appear perfect in her soul. I encouraged
      her to talk. I saw with devilish irony that an angel spoke. And, to cap it
      all, she assumed the fascinating air of the mediator&mdash;for her
      brother; seeking a reconciliation between us. Her amazing art of person
      and mind so worked upon me that it became unendurable; it was so exquisite&mdash;and
      so shameless. I was sitting where the priest had sat that afternoon; and
      when she leaned towards me I caught her chin lightly and trailed my
      fingers through her hair as he had done: and that ended it, for I was
      cold, and my heart worked with horrible slowness. Just as a wave poises at
      its height before breaking upon the shore, it hung at every pulse-beat,
      and then seemed to fall over with a sickening thud. I arose, and acting
      still, spoke impatiently of her brother. Tears sprang to her eyes. Such
      divine dissimulation, I thought&mdash;too good for earth. She turned to
      leave the room, and I did not stay her. Yet we were together again that
      night.... I was only waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cigarette had dropped from his fingers to the floor, and lay there
      smoking. Shon&rsquo;s face was fixed with anxiety; Pierre&rsquo;s eyes played gravely
      with the sunshine. Wendling drew a heavy breath, and then went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, next day, it was like this-the world draining the heat.... I
      watched from the Big Mill. I saw them again. He leaned over her chair and
      buried his face in her hair. The proof was absolute now.... I started
      away, going a roundabout, that I might not be seen. It took me some time.
      I was passing through a clump of cedar when I saw them making towards the
      trees skirting the river. Their backs were on me. Suddenly they diverted
      their steps&mdash;towards the great slide, shut off from water this last
      few months, and used as a quarry to deepen it. Some petrified things had
      been found in the rocks, but I did not think they were going to these. I
      saw them climb down the rocky steps; and presently they were lost to view.
      The gates of the slide could be opened by machinery from the Little Mill.
      A terrible, deliciously malignant thought came to me. I remember how the
      sunlight crept away from me and left me in the dark. I stole through that
      darkness to the Little Mill. I went to the machinery for opening the
      gates. Very gently I set it in motion, facing the slide as I did so. I
      could see it through the open sides of the mill. I smiled to think what
      the tiny creek, always creeping through a faint leak in the gates and
      falling with a granite rattle on the stones, would now become. I pushed
      the lever harder&mdash;harder. I saw the gates suddenly give, then fly
      open, and the river sprang roaring massively through them. I heard a
      shriek through the roar. I shuddered; and a horrible sickness came on
      me.... And as I turned from the machinery, I saw the young priest coming
      at me through a doorway!... It was not the priest and my wife that I had
      killed; but my wife and her brother....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his head back as though something clamped his throat. His voice
      roughened with misery. &ldquo;The young priest buried them both, and people did
      not know the truth. They were even sorry for me. But I gave up the mills&mdash;all;
      and I became homeless... this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now he looked up at the two men, and said: &ldquo;I have told you because you
      know something, and because there will, I think, be an end soon.&rdquo; He got
      up and reached out a trembling hand for a cigarette. Pierre gave him one.
      &ldquo;Will you walk with me&rdquo;? he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon shook his head. &ldquo;God forgive you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Wendling and Pierre left the hut together. They walked for an hour,
      scarcely speaking, and not considering where they went. At last Pierre
      mechanically turned to go down into Red Glen. Wendling stopped short,
      then, with a sighing laugh, strode on. &ldquo;Shoo has told you what happened
      here&rdquo;? he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know what came once when you walked with me.... The dead can
      strike,&rdquo; he added. Pierre sought his eye. &ldquo;The minister and the girl
      buried together that day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, for behind him he heard the sharp, cold trickle of water.
      Silent they walked on. It followed them. They could not get out of the
      Glen now until they had compassed its length&mdash;the walls were high.
      The sound grew. The men faced each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Wendling; and he reached out his hand swiftly. But Pierre
      heard a mighty flood groaning on them, and he blinded as he stretched his
      arm in response. He caught at Wendling&rsquo;s shoulder, but felt him lifted and
      carried away, while he himself stood still in a screeching wind and heard
      impalpable water rushing over him. In a minute it was gone; and he stood
      alone in Red Glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered himself up and ran. Far down, where the Glen opened to the
      plain, he found Wendling. The hands were wrinkled; the face was cold; the
      body was wet: the man was drowned and dead.

    <h2>
      IN PIPI VALLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divils me darlins, it&rsquo;s a memory I have of a time whin luck wasn&rsquo;t
      foldin&rsquo; her arms round me, and not so far back aither, and I on the
      wallaby track hot-foot for the City o&rsquo; Gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon McGann said this in the course of a discussion on the prosperity of
      Pipi Valley. Pretty Pierre remarked nonchalantly in reply,&mdash;&ldquo;The
      wallaby track&mdash;eh&mdash;what is that, Shon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a haythen y&rsquo; are, Pierre. The wallaby track? That&rsquo;s the
      name in Australia for trampin&rsquo; west through the plains of the Never-Never
      Country lookin&rsquo; for the luck o&rsquo; the world; as, bedad, it&rsquo;s meself that
      knows it, and no other, and not by book or tellin&rsquo; either, but with the
      grip of thirst at me throat and a reef in me belt every hour to quiet the
      gnawin&rsquo;.&rdquo; And Shon proceeded to light his pipe afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the City o&rsquo; Gold-was there much wealth for you there, Shon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon laughed, and said between the puffs of smoke, &ldquo;Wealth for me, is it?
      Oh, mother o&rsquo; Moses! wealth of work and the pride of livin&rsquo; in the heart
      of us, and the grip of an honest hand betunewhiles; and what more do y&rsquo; 
      want, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman&rsquo;s drooping eyelids closed a little more, and he replied,
      meditatively: &ldquo;Money? No, that is not Shon McGann. The good fellowship of
      thirst?&mdash;yes, a little. The grip of the honest hand, quite, and the
      clinch of an honest waist? Well, &lsquo;peut-etre.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the waist which is not honest?&mdash;tsh! he is gay&mdash;and so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman took his pipe from his mouth, and held it poised before him.
      He looked inquiringly and a little frowningly at the other for a moment,
      as if doubtful whether to resent the sneer that accompanied the words just
      spoken; but at last he good-humouredly said: &ldquo;Blood o&rsquo; me bones, but it&rsquo;s
      much I fear the honest waist hasn&rsquo;t always been me portion&mdash;Heaven
      forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nom de pipe,&rsquo; this Irishman!&rdquo; replied Pierre. &ldquo;He is gay; of good heart;
      he smiles, and the women are at his heels; he laughs, and they are on
      their knees&mdash;Such a fool he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Shon McGann laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool I am, Pierre, or I&rsquo;d be in ould Ireland at this minute, with a
      roof o&rsquo; me own over me and the friends o&rsquo; me youth round me, and brats on
      me knee, and the fear o&rsquo; God in me heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mais,&rsquo; Shon,&rdquo; mockingly rejoined the Frenchman, &ldquo;this is not Ireland,
      but there is much like that to be done here. There is a roof, and there is
      that woman at Ward&rsquo;s Mistake, and the brats&mdash;eh, by and by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shon&rsquo;s face clouded. He hesitated, then replied sharply: &ldquo;That woman, do
      y&rsquo; say, Pierre, she that nursed me when the Honourable and meself were
      taken out o&rsquo; Sandy Drift, more dead than livin&rsquo;; she that brought me back
      to life as good as ever, barrin&rsquo; this scar on me forehead and a stiffness
      at me elbow, and the Honourable as right as the sun, more luck to him!
      which he doesn&rsquo;t need at all, with the wind of fortune in his back and
      shiftin&rsquo; neither to right nor left.&mdash;That woman! faith, y&rsquo;d better
      not cut the words so sharp betune yer teeth, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will say more&mdash;a little&mdash;just the same. She nursed you&mdash;well,
      that is good; but it is good also, I think, you pay her for that, and stop
      the rest. Women are fools, or else they are worse. This one? She is worse.
      Yes; you will take my advice, Shon McGann.&rdquo; The Irishman came to his feet
      with a spring, and his words were angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t come well from Pretty Pierre, the gambler, to be revilin&rsquo; a
      woman; and I throw it in y&rsquo;r face, though I&rsquo;ve slept under the same
      blanket with ye, an&rsquo; drunk out of the same cup on manny a tramp, that you
      lie dirty and black when ye spake ill&mdash;of my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation had occurred in a quiet corner of the bar-room of the
      Saints&rsquo; Repose. The first few sentences had not been heard by the others
      present; but Shon&rsquo;s last speech, delivered in a ringing tone, drew the
      miners to their feet, in expectation of seeing shots exchanged at once.
      The code required satisfaction, immediate and decisive. Shon was not
      armed, and some one thrust a pistol towards him; but he did not take it.
      Pierre rose, and coming slowly to him, laid a slender finger on his chest,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! I did not know that she was your wife. That is a surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The miners nodded assent. He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy Rives your wife! Hola, Shon McGann, that is such a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke, but God&rsquo;s truth, and the lie is with you, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murmurs of anticipation ran round the room; but the half-breed said:
      &ldquo;There will be satisfaction altogether; but it is my whim to prove what I
      say first; then&rdquo;&mdash;fondling his revolver&mdash;&ldquo;then we shall settle.
      But, see: you will meet me here at ten o&rsquo;clock to-night, and I will make
      it, I swear to you, so clear, that the woman is vile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman suddenly clutched the gambler, shook him like a dog, and
      threw him against the farther wall. Pierre&rsquo;s pistol was levelled from the
      instant Shon moved; but he did not use it. He rose on one knee after the
      violent fall, and pointing it at the other&rsquo;s head, said coolly: &ldquo;I could
      kill you, my friend, so easy! But it is not my whim. Till ten o&rsquo;clock is
      not long to wait, and then, just here, one of us shall die. Is it not so?&rdquo;
       The Irishman did not flinch before the pistol. He said with low
      fierceness, &ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock, or now, or any time, or at any place, y&rsquo;ll
      find me ready to break the back of the lies y&rsquo;ve spoken, or be broken
      meself. Lucy Rives is my wife, and she&rsquo;s true and straight as the sun in
      the sky. I&rsquo;ll be here at ten o&rsquo;clock, and as ye say, Pierre, one of us
      makes the long reckoning for this.&rdquo; And he opened the door and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed moved to the bar, and, throwing down a handful of silver,
      said: &ldquo;It is good we drink after so much heat. Come on, come on,
      comrades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The miners responded to the invitation. Their sympathy was mostly with
      Shon McGann; their admiration was about equally divided; for Pretty Pierre
      had the quality of courage in as active a degree as the Irishman, and they
      knew that some extraordinary motive, promising greater excitement, was
      behind the Frenchman&rsquo;s refusal to send a bullet through Shon&rsquo;s head a
      moment before.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Kinkley, the best shot in the Valley next to Pierre, had watched the
      unusual development of the incident with interest; and when his glass had
      been filled he said, thoughtfully: &ldquo;This thing isn&rsquo;t according to Hoyle.
      There&rsquo;s never been any trouble just like it in the Valley before. What&rsquo;s
      that McGann said about the lady being his wife? If it&rsquo;s the case, where
      hev we been in the show? Where was we when the license was around? It
      isn&rsquo;t good citizenship, and I hev my doubts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another miner, known as the Presbyterian, added: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some skulduggery
      in it, I guess. The lady has had as much protection as if she was the
      sister of every citizen of the place, just as much as Lady Jane here (Lady
      Jane, the daughter of the proprietor of the Saints&rsquo; Repose, administered
      drinks), and she&rsquo;s played this stacked hand on us, has gone one better on
      the sly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre,&rdquo; said King Kinkley, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on the track of the secret, and
      appear to hev the advantage of the lady: blaze it&mdash;blaze it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre rejoined, &ldquo;I know something; but it is good we wait until ten
      o&rsquo;clock. Then I will show you all the cards in the pack. Yes, so, &lsquo;bien
      sur.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And though there was some grumbling, Pierre had his way. The spirit of
      adventure and mutual interest had thrown the French half-breed, the
      Irishman, and the Hon. Just Trafford together on the cold side of the
      Canadian Rockies; and they had journeyed to this other side, where the
      warm breath from the Pacific passed to its congealing in the ranges. They
      had come to the Pipi field when it was languishing. From the moment of
      their coming its luck changed; it became prosperous. They conquered the
      Valley each after his kind. The Honourable&mdash;he was always called that&mdash;mastered
      its resources by a series of &ldquo;great lucks,&rdquo; as Pierre termed it, had
      achieved a fortune, and made no enemies; and but two months before the day
      whose incidents are here recorded, had gone to the coast on business. Shon
      had won the reputation of being a &ldquo;white man,&rdquo; to say nothing of his
      victories in the region of gallantry. He made no wealth; he only got that
      he might spend. Irishman-like he would barter the chances of fortune for
      the lilt of a voice or the clatter of a pretty foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was different. &ldquo;Women, ah, no!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;they make men fools
      or devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His temptation lay not that way. When the three first came to the Pipi,
      Pierre was a miner, simply; but nearly all his life he had been something
      else, as many a devastated pocket on the east of the Rockies could bear
      witness; and his new career was alien to his soul. Temptation grew greatly
      on him at the Pipi, and in the days before he yielded to it he might have
      been seen at midnight in his but playing solitaire. Why he abstained at
      first from practising his real profession is accounted for in two ways: he
      had tasted some of the sweets of honest companionship with the Honourable
      and Shon, and then he had a memory of an ugly night at Pardon&rsquo;s Drive a
      year before, when he stood over his own brother&rsquo;s body, shot to death by
      accident in a gambling row having its origin with himself. These things
      had held him back for a time; but he was weaker than his ruling passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pipi was a young and comparatively virgin field; the quarry was at his
      hand. He did not love money for its own sake; it was the game that
      enthralled him. He would have played his life against the treasury of a
      kingdom, and, winning it with loaded double sixes, have handed back the
      spoil as an unredeemable national debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell at last, and in falling conquered the Pipi Valley; at the same
      time he was considered a fearless and liberal citizen, who could shoot as
      straight as he played well. He made an excursion to another field,
      however, at an opportune time, and it was during this interval that the
      accident to Shon and the Honourable had happened. He returned but a few
      hours before this quarrel with Shon occurred, and in the Saints&rsquo; Repose,
      whither he had at once gone, he was told of the accident. While his
      informant related the incident and the romantic sequence of Shon&rsquo;s
      infatuation, the woman passed the tavern and was pointed out to Pierre.
      The half-breed had not much excitableness in his nature, but when he saw
      this beautiful woman with a touch of the Indian in her contour, his pale
      face flushed, and he showed his set teeth under his slight moustache. He
      watched her until she entered a shop, on the signboard of which was
      written&mdash;written since he had left a few months ago&mdash;Lucy Rives,
      Tobacconist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon had then entered the Saints&rsquo; Repose; and we know the rest. A couple
      of hours after this nervous episode, Pierre might have been seen standing
      in the shadow of the pines not far from the house at Ward&rsquo;s Mistake,
      where, he had been told, Lucy Rives lived with an old Indian woman. He
      stood, scarcely moving, and smoking cigarettes, until the door opened.
      Shon came out and walked down the hillside to the town. Then Pierre went
      to the door, and without knocking, opened it, and entered. A woman started
      up from a seat where she was sewing, and turned towards him. As she did
      so, the work, Shon&rsquo;s coat, dropped from her hands, her face paled, and her
      eyes grew big with fear. She leaned against a chair for support&mdash;this
      man&rsquo;s presence had weakened her so. She stood silent, save for a slight
      moan that broke from her lips, as Pierre lighted a cigarette coolly, and
      then said to an old Indian woman who sat upon the floor braiding a basket:
      &ldquo;Get up, Ikni, and go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ikni rose, came over, and peered into the face of the half-breed. Then she
      muttered: &ldquo;I know you&mdash;I know you. The dead has come back again.&rdquo; She
      caught his arm with her bony fingers as if to satisfy herself that he was
      flesh and blood, and shaking her head dolefully, went from the room. When
      the door closed behind her there was silence, broken only by an
      exclamation from the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other drew her hand across her eyes, and dropped it with a motion of
      despair. Then Pierre said, sharply: &ldquo;Bien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francois,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you are alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am alive, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, then grew still again and whispered: &ldquo;Why did you let it be
      thought that you were drowned? Why? Oh, why&rdquo;? she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyebrows slightly, and between the puffs of smoke, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, my Lucy, why? It was so long ago. Let me see: so&mdash;so&mdash;ten
      years. Ten years is a long time to remember, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came towards her. She drew back; but her hand remained on the chair. He
      touched the plain gold ring on her finger, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still wear it. To think of that&mdash;so loyal for a woman! How she
      remembers, holy Mother!... But shall I not kiss you, yes, just once after
      eight years&mdash;my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She breathed hard and drew back against the wall, dazed and frightened,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, do not come near me; do not speak to me&mdash;ah, please, stand
      back, for a moment&mdash;please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders slightly, and continued, with mock tenderness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that things come round so! And here you have a home. But that is
      good. I am tired of much travel and life all alone. The prodigal goes not
      to the home, the home comes to the prodigal.&rdquo; He stretched up his arms as
      if with a feeling of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;do you not know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not know, Lucy, that this is your home? Yes. But is it not all the
      same? I gave you a home ten years ago&mdash;to think, ten years ago! We
      quarrelled one night, and I left you. Next morning my boat was found below
      the White Cascade&mdash;yes, but that was so stale a trick! It was not
      worthy of Francois Rives. He would do it so much better now; but he was
      young then; just a boy, and foolish. Well, sit down, Lucy, it is a long
      story, and you have much to tell, how much&mdash;who knows?&rdquo; She came
      slowly forward and said with a painful effort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did a great wrong, Francois. You have killed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed you, Lucy, my wife! Pardon! Never in those days did you look so
      charming as now&mdash;never. But the great surprise of seeing your
      husband, it has made you shy, quite shy. There will be much time now for
      you to change all that. It is quite pleasant to think on, Lucy.... You
      remember the song we used to sing on the Chaudiere at St. Antoine? See, I
      have not forgotten it&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;&lsquo;Nos amants sont en guerre,
          Vole, mon coeur, vole.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He hummed the lines over and over, watching through his half-shut eyes the
      torture he was inflicting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mother of God,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;have mercy! Can you not see, do you
      not know? I am not as you left me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my wife, you are just the same; not an hour older. I am glad that
      you have come to me. But how they will envy Pretty Pierre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Envy&mdash;Pretty-Pierre,&rdquo; she repeated, in distress; &ldquo;are you Pretty
      Pierre? Ah, I might have known, I might have known!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and so! Is not Pretty Pierre as good a name as Francois Rives? Is it
      not as good as Shon McGann?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see it all, I see it all now!&rdquo; she said mournfully. &ldquo;It was with
      you he quarrelled, and about me. He would not tell me what it was. You
      know, then, that I am&mdash;that I am married&mdash;to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. I know all that; but it is no marriage.&rdquo; He rose to his feet
      slowly, dropping the cigarette from his lips as he did so. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;and I know that you prefer Shon McGann to Pretty Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spread out her hands appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are my wife, not his. Listen: do you know what I shall do? I will
      tell you in two hours. It is now eight o&rsquo;clock. At ten o&rsquo;clock Shon McGann
      will meet me at the Saints&rsquo; Repose. Then you shall know.... Ah, it is a
      pity! Shon was my good friend, but this spoils all that. Wine&mdash;it has
      danger; cards&mdash;there is peril in that sport; women&mdash;they make
      trouble most of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God,&rdquo; she piteously said, &ldquo;what did I do? There was no sin in me. I was
      your faithful wife, though you were cruel to me. You left me, cheated me,
      brought this upon me. It is you that has done this wickedness, not I.&rdquo; She
      buried her face in her hands, falling on her knees beside the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent above her: &ldquo;You loved the young avocat better, eight years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Ah, now I understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That was why
      you quarrelled with me; why you deserted me. You were not man enough to
      say what made you so much the&mdash;so wicked and hard, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be thankful, Lucy, that I did not kill you then,&rdquo; he interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a lie,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door and called the Indian woman. &ldquo;Ikni,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He
      dares to say evil of Andre and me. Think&mdash;of Andre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ikni came to him, put her wrinkled face close to his, and said: &ldquo;She was
      yours, only yours; but the spirits gave you a devil. Andre, oh, oh, Andre!
      The father of Andre was her father&mdash;ah, that makes your sulky eyes to
      open. Ikni knows how to speak. Ikni nursed them both. If you had waited
      you should have known. But you ran away like a wolf from a coal of fire;
      you shammed death like a fox; you come back like the snake to crawl into
      the house and strike with poison tooth, when you should be with the worms
      in the ground. But Ikni knows&mdash;you shall be struck with poison too,
      the Spirit of the Red Knife waits for you. Andre was her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed her aside savagely: &ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get out-quick. &lsquo;Sacre&rsquo;&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone again he continued with no anger in his tone: &ldquo;So,
      Andre the avocat and you&mdash;that, eh? Well, you see how much trouble
      has come; and now this other&mdash;a secret too. When were you married to
      Shon McGann?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; she bitterly replied; &ldquo;a priest came over from the Indian
      village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; he musingly repeated. &ldquo;Last night I lost two thousand
      dollars at the Little Goshen field. I did not play well last night; I was
      nervous. In ten years I had not lost so much at one game as I did last
      night. It was a punishment for playing too honest, or something; eh, what
      do you think, Lucy&mdash;or something, &lsquo;hein?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but rocked her body to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not make known the marriage with Shon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was to have told it to-night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, then a thought flashed into his eyes, and
      he rejoined with a jarring laugh, &ldquo;Well, I will play a game to-night, Lucy
      Rives; such a game that Pretty Pierre will never be forgotten in the Pipi
      Valley&mdash;a beautiful game, just for two. And the other who will play&mdash;the
      wife of Francois Rives shall see if she will wait; but she must be
      patient, more patient than her husband was ten years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do&mdash;tell me, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will play a game of cards&mdash;just one magnificent game; and the
      cards shall settle it. All shall be quite fair, as when you and I played
      in the little house by the Chaudiere&mdash;at first, Lucy,&mdash;before I
      was a devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this peculiar softness to his last tones assumed or real? She looked
      at him inquiringly; but he moved away to the window, and stood gazing down
      the hillside towards the town below. His eyes smarted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will die,&rdquo; she said to herself in whispers&mdash;&ldquo;I will die.&rdquo; A minute
      passed, and then Pierre turned and said to her: &ldquo;Lucy, he is coming up the
      hill. Listen. If you tell him that I have seen you, I will shoot him on
      sight, dead. You would save him, for a little, for an hour or two&mdash;or
      more? Well, do as I say; for these things must be according to the rules
      of the game, and I myself will tell him all at the Saints&rsquo; Repose. He gave
      me the lie there, and I will tell him the truth before them all there.
      Will you do as I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated an instant, and then replied: &ldquo;I will not tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one way, then,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You must go at once from
      here into the woods behind there, and not see him at all. Then at ten
      o&rsquo;clock you will come to the Saints&rsquo; Repose, if you choose, to know how
      the game has ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling, moaning, no longer. A set look had come into her face;
      her eyes were steady and hard. She quietly replied: &ldquo;Yes, I shall be
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to her, took her hand, and drew from her finger the wedding-ring
      which last night Shon McGann had placed there. She submitted passively.
      Then, with an upward wave of his fingers, he spoke in a mocking lightness,
      but without any of the malice which had first appeared in his tones, words
      from an old French song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;I say no more, my lady
          Mironton, Mironton, Mirontaine!
          I say no more, my lady,
          As nought more can be said.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He opened the door, motioned to the Indian woman, and, in a few moments,
      the broken-hearted Lucy Rives and her companion were hidden in the pines;
      and Pretty Pierre also disappeared into the shadow of the woods as Shon
      McGann appeared on the crest of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman walked slowly to the door, and pausing, said to himself: &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t run the big risk, me darlin&rsquo;, without seein&rsquo; you again, God help
      me! There&rsquo;s danger ahead which little I&rsquo;d care for if it wasn&rsquo;t for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he stepped inside the house&mdash;the place was silent; he called,
      but no one answered; he threw open the doors of the rooms, but they were
      empty; he went outside and called again, but no reply came, except the
      flutter of a night-hawk&rsquo;s wings and the cry of a whippoorwill. He went
      back into the house and sat down with his head between his hands. So, for
      a moment, and then he raised his head, and said with a sad smile: &ldquo;Faith,
      Shon, me boy, this takes the life out of you! the empty house where she
      ought to be, and the smile of her so swate, and the hand of her that falls
      on y&rsquo;r shoulder like a dove on the blessed altar-gone, and lavin&rsquo; a chill
      on y&rsquo;r heart like a touch of the dead. Sure, nivir a wan of me saw any
      that could stand wid her for goodness, barrin&rsquo; the angel that kissed me
      good-bye with one foot in the stirrup an&rsquo; the troopers behind me, now
      twelve years gone, in ould Donegal, and that I&rsquo;ll niver see again, she
      lyin&rsquo; where the hate of the world will vex the heart of her no more, and
      the masses gone up for her soul. Twice, twice in y&rsquo;r life, Shon McGann,
      has the cup of God&rsquo;s joy been at y&rsquo;r lips, and is it both times that it&rsquo;s
      to spill?&mdash;Pretty Pierre shoots straight and sudden, and maybe it&rsquo;s
      aisy to see the end of it; but as the just God is above us, I&rsquo;ll give him
      the lie in his throat betimes for the word he said agin me darlin&rsquo;. What&rsquo;s
      the avil thing that he has to say? What&rsquo;s the divil&rsquo;s proof he would
      bring? And where is she now? Where are you, Lucy? I know the proof I&rsquo;ve
      got in me heart that the wreck of the world couldn&rsquo;t shake, while that
      light, born of Heaven, swims up to your eyes whin you look at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet again and walked to and fro; he went once more to the
      doors; he looked here and there through the growing dusk, but to no
      purpose. She had said that she would not go to her shop this night; but if
      not, then where could she have gone and Ikni, too? He felt there was more
      awry in his life than he cared to put into thought or speech. He picked up
      the sewing she had dropped and looked at it as one would regard a relic of
      the dead; he lifted her handkerchief, kissed it, and put it in his breast.
      He took a revolver from his pocket and examined it closely, looked round
      the room as though to fasten it in his memory, and then passed out,
      closing the door behind him. He walked down the hillside and went to her
      shop in the one street of the town, but she was not there, nor had the lad
      in charge seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Pretty Pierre had made his way to the Saints&rsquo; Repose, and was
      sitting among the miners indolently smoking. In vain he was asked to play
      cards. His one reply was, &ldquo;No, pardon, no! I play one game only to-night,
      the biggest game ever played in Pipi Valley.&rdquo; In vain, also, was he asked
      to drink. He refused the hospitality, defying the danger that such lack of
      good-fellowship might bring forth. He hummed in patches to himself the
      words of a song that the &lsquo;brules&rsquo; were wont to sing when they hunted the
      buffalo:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;&lsquo;Voila!&rsquo; it is the sport to ride&mdash;
             Ah, ah the brave hunter!

          To thrust the arrow in his hide,
          To send the bullet through his side
             &lsquo;Ici,&rsquo; the buffalo, &lsquo;joli!&rsquo; 
               Ah, ah the buffalo!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He nodded here and there as men entered; but he did not stir from his
      seat. He smoked incessantly, and his eyes faced the door of the bar-room
      that entered upon the street. There was no doubt in the minds of any
      present that the promised excitement would occur. Shon McGann was as
      fearless as he was gay. And Pipi Valley remembered the day in which he had
      twice risked his life to save two women from a burning building&mdash;Lady
      Jane and another. And Lady Jane this evening was agitated, and once or
      twice furtively looked at something under the bar-counter; in fact, a
      close observer would have noticed anger or anxiety in the eyes of the
      daughter of Dick Waldron, the keeper of the Saints&rsquo; Repose. Pierre would
      certainly have seen it had he been looking that way. An unusual influence
      was working upon the frequenters of the busy tavern. Planned, premeditated
      excitement was out of their line. Unexpectedness was the salt of their
      existence. This thing had an air of system not in accord with the
      suddenness of the Pipi mind. The half-breed was the only one entirely at
      his ease; he was languid and nonchalant; the long lashes of his half-shut
      eyelids gave his face a pensive look. At last King Kinkley walked over to
      him and said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an almighty mysteriousness about this event which
      isn&rsquo;t joyful, Pretty Pierre. We want to see the muss cleared up, of
      course; we want Shon McGann to act like a high-toned citizen, and there&rsquo;s
      a general prejudice in favour of things bein&rsquo; on the flat of your palm, as
      it were. Now this thing hangs fire, and there&rsquo;s a lack of animation about
      it, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this, Pretty Pierre replied: &ldquo;What can I do? This is not like other
      things; one had to wait; great things take time. To shoot is easy; but to
      shoot is not all, as you shall see if you have a little patience. Ah, my
      friend, where there is a woman, things are different. I throw a glass in
      your face, we shoot, someone dies, and there it is quite plain of reason;
      you play a card which was dealt just now, I call you&mdash;something, and
      the swiftest finger does the trick; but in such as this, one must wait for
      the sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Shon McGann entered, looked round, nodded to
      all, and then came forward to the table where Pretty Pierre sat. As the
      other took out his watch, Shon said firmly but quietly: &ldquo;Pierre, I gave
      you the lie to-day concerning me wife, and I&rsquo;m here, as I said I&rsquo;d be, to
      stand by the word I passed then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre waved his fingers lightly towards the other, and slowly rose. Then
      he said in sharp tones: &ldquo;Yes, Shon McGann, you gave me the lie. There is
      but one thing for that in Pipi Valley. You choked me; I would not take
      that from a saint of heaven; but there was another thing to do first.
      Well, I have done it; I said I would bring proofs&mdash;I have them.&rdquo; He
      paused, and now there might have been seen a shining moisture on his
      forehead, and his words came menacingly from between his teeth, while the
      room became breathlessly still, save that in the silence a sleeping dog
      sighed heavily: &ldquo;Shon McGann,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you are living with my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty men drew in a sharp breath of excitement, and Shon came a step
      nearer the other, and said in a strange voice: &ldquo;I&mdash;am&mdash;living&mdash;with&mdash;your&mdash;wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say, with my wife, Lucy Rives. Francois Rives was my name ten years
      ago. We quarrelled. I left her, and I never saw her again until to-night.
      You went to see her two hours ago. You did not find her. Why? She was gone
      because her husband, Pierre, told her to go. You want a proof? You shall
      have it. Here is the wedding-ring you gave her last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed it over, and Shon saw inside it his own name and hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did she know? Tell me she didn&rsquo;t know, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she did not know. I have truth to speak to night. I was jealous, mad,
      and foolish, and I left her. My boat was found upset. They believed I was
      drowned. &lsquo;Bien,&rsquo; she waited until yesterday, and then she took you&mdash;but
      she was my wife; she is my wife&mdash;and so you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman was deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an avil heart y&rsquo; had in y&rsquo; then, Pretty Pierre, and it&rsquo;s an avil day
      that brought this thing to pass, and there&rsquo;s only wan way to the end of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, that is true. There is only one way,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but what shall
      that way be? Someone must go: there must be no mistake. I have to propose.
      Here on this table we lay a revolver. We will give up these which we have
      in our pockets. Then we will play a game of euchre, and the winner of the
      game shall have the revolver. We will play for a life. That is fair, eh&mdash;that
      is fair&rdquo;? he said to those around.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Kinkley, speaking for the rest, replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about fair. It gives
      both a chance, and leaves only two when it&rsquo;s over. While the woman lives,
      one of you is naturally in the way. Pierre left her in a way that isn&rsquo;t
      handsome; but a wife&rsquo;s a wife, and though Shon was all in the glum about
      the thing, and though the woman isn&rsquo;t to be blamed either, there&rsquo;s one too
      many of you, and there&rsquo;s got to be a vacation for somebody. Isn&rsquo;t that
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest nodded assent. They had been so engaged that they did not see a
      woman enter the bar from behind, and crouch down beside Lady Jane, a woman
      whom the latter touched affectionately on the shoulder and whispered to
      once or twice, while she watched the preparations for the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men sat down, Shon facing the bar and Pierre with his back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game began, neither man showing a sign of nervousness, though Shon was
      very pale. The game was to finish for ten points. Men crowded about the
      tables silent but keenly excited; cigars were chewed instead of smoked,
      and liquor was left undrunk. At the first deal Pierre made a march,
      securing two. At the next Shon made a point, and at the next also a march.
      The half-breed was playing a straight game. He could have stacked the
      cards, but he did not do so; deft as he was he might have cheated even the
      vigilant eyes about him, but it was not so; he played as squarely as a
      novice. At the third, at the fourth, deal he made a march; at the fifth,
      sixth, and seventh deals, Shon made a march, a point, and a march. Both
      now had eight points. At the next deal both got a point, and both stood at
      nine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came the crucial play.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the progress of the game nothing had been heard save the sound of a
      knuckle on the table, the flip flip of the pasteboard, or the rasp of a
      heel on the floor. There was a set smile on Shon&rsquo;s face&mdash;a forgotten
      smile, for the rest of the face was stern and tragic. Pierre smoked
      cigarettes, pausing, while his opponent was shuffling and dealing, to
      light them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the bar as the game proceeded the woman who knelt beside Lady Jane
      listened to every sound. Her eyes grew more agonised as the numbers,
      whispered to her by her companion, climbed to the fatal ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last deal was Shon&rsquo;s; there was that much to his advantage. As he
      slowly dealt, the woman&mdash;Lucy Rives&mdash;rose to her feet behind
      Lady Jane. So absorbed were all that none saw her. Her eyes passed from
      Pierre to Shon, and stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cards were dealt, with but one point for either to gain, and so
      win and save his life, there was a slight pause before the two took them
      up. They did not look at one another; but each glanced at the revolver,
      then at the men nearest them, and lastly, for an instant, at the cards
      themselves, with their pasteboard faces of life and death turned downward.
      As the players picked them up at last and spread them out fan-like, Lady
      Jane slipped something into the hand of Lucy Rives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who stood behind Shon McGann stared with anxious astonishment at his
      hand; it contained only nine and ten spots. It was easy to see the
      direction of the sympathy of Pipi Valley. The Irishman&rsquo;s face turned a
      slight shade paler, but he did not tremble or appear disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre played his biggest card and took the point. He coolly counted one,
      and said, &ldquo;Game. I win.&rdquo; The crowd drew back. Both rose to their feet. In
      the painful silence the half-breed&rsquo;s hand was gently laid on the revolver.
      He lifted it, and paused slightly, his eyes fixed to the steady look in
      those of Shon McGann. He raised the revolver again, till it was level with
      Shon&rsquo;s forehead, till it was even with his hair! Then there was a shot,
      and someone fell&mdash;not Shon, but Pierre, saying, as they caught him,
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! From behind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly there was another shot, and someone crashed against the bottles
      in the bar. The other factor in the game, the wife, had shot at Pierre,
      and then sent a bullet through her own lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon stood for a moment as if he was turned to stone, and then his head
      dropped in his arms upon the table. He had seen both shots fired, but
      could not speak in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was severely but not dangerously wounded in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the woman&mdash;? They brought her out from behind the counter. She
      still breathed; but on her eyes was the film of coming death. She turned
      to where Shon sat. Her lips framed his name, but no voice came forth.
      Someone touched him on the shoulder. He looked up and caught her last
      glance. He came and stooped beside her; but she had died with that one
      glance from him, bringing a faint smile to her lips. And the smile stayed
      when the life of her had fled&mdash;fled through the cloud over her eyes,
      from the tide-beat of her pulse. It swept out from the smoke and reeking
      air into the open world, and beyond, into those untried paths where all
      must walk alone, and in what bitterness, known only to the Master of the
      World who sees these piteous things, and orders in what fashion distorted
      lives shall be made straight and wholesome in the Places of Readjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon stood silent above the dead body.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the miners went out quietly. Presently Pierre nodded towards
      the door, and King Kinkley and another lifted him and carried him towards
      it. Before they passed into the street he made them turn him so that he
      could see Shon. He waved his hand towards her that had been his wife, and
      said: &ldquo;She should have shot but once and straight, Shon McGann, and then!&mdash;Eh,
      &lsquo;bien!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed, and Shon McGann was left alone with the dead.

    <h2>
      ANTOINE AND ANGELIQUE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;The birds are going south, Antoine&mdash;see&mdash;and it is so early!&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Angelique, the winter will be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and then: &ldquo;Antoine, I heard a child cry in the night,
      and I could not sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a devil-bird, my wife; it flies slowly, and the summer is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antoine, there was a rushing of wings by my bed before the morn was
      breaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wild-geese know their way in the night, Angelique; but they flew by
      the house and not near thy bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two black squirrels have gone from the hickory tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have hidden away with the bears in the earth; for the frost comes,
      and it is the time of sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cold hand was knocking at my heart when I said my aves last night, my
      Antoine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heart of a woman feels many strange things: I cannot answer, my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go also southward, Antoine, before the great winds and the wild
      frost come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love thee, Angelique, but I cannot go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not love greater than all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep a pledge is greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet if evil come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None travels hither; who should find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said to me, my wife: &lsquo;Antoine, will you stay and watch the mine until
      I come with the birds northward, again?&rsquo; and I said: &lsquo;I will stay, and
      Angelique will stay; I will watch the mine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is for his riches, but for our peril, Antoine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can say whither a woman&rsquo;s fancy goes? It is full of guessing. It is
      clouds and darkness to-day, and sunshine&mdash;so much&mdash;to-morrow. I
      cannot answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a fear; if my husband loved me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the mine,&rdquo; he interrupted firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my heart aches so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angelique, there is the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my Antoine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so these two stayed on the island of St. Jean, in Lake Superior,
      through the purple haze of autumn, into the white brilliancy of winter,
      guarding the Rose Tree Mine, which Falding the Englishman and his
      companions had prospected and declared to be their Ophir.
    </p>
    <p>
      But St. Jean was far from the ways of settlement, and there was little
      food and only one hut, and many things must be done for the Rose Tree Mine
      in the places where men sell their souls for money; and Antoine and
      Angelique, French peasants from the parish of Ste. Irene in Quebec, were
      left to guard the place of treasure, until, to the sound of the laughing
      spring, there should come many men and much machinery, and the sinking of
      shafts in the earth, and the making, of riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Antoine and Angelique were left alone in the waste, and God began
      to draw the pale coverlet of frost slowly across land and water, and to
      surround St. Jean with a stubborn moat of ice, the heart of the woman felt
      some coming danger, and at last broke forth in words of timid warning.
      When she once had spoken she said no more, but stayed and builded the
      heaps of earth about the house, and filled every crevice against the
      inhospitable Spirit of Winds, and drew her world closer and closer within
      those two rooms where they should live through many months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter was harsh, but the hearts of the two were strong. They loved;
      and Love is the parent of endurance, the begetter of courage. And every
      day, because it seemed his duty, Antoine inspected the Rose Tree Mine; and
      every day also, because it seemed her duty, Angelique said many aves. And
      one prayer was much with her&mdash;for spring to come early that the child
      should not suffer: the child which the good God was to give to her and
      Antoine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first hours of each evening Antoine smoked, and Angelique sang the
      old songs which their ancestors learned in Normandy. One night Antoine&rsquo;s
      face was lighted with a fine fire as he talked of happy days in the parish
      of Ste. Irene; and with that romantic fervour of his race which the stern
      winters of Canada could not kill, he sang, &lsquo;A la Claire Fontaine,&rsquo; the
      well-beloved song-child of the &lsquo;voyageurs&rsquo;&rsquo; hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the wife smiled far away into the dancing flames&mdash;far away,
      because the fire retreated, retreated to the little church where they two
      were wed; and she did as most good women do&mdash;though exactly why, man
      the insufficient cannot declare&mdash;she wept a little through her
      smiles. But when the last verse came, both smiles and tears ceased.
      Antoine sang it with a fond monotony:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Would that each rose were growing
        Upon the rose-tree gay,
        And that the fatal rose-tree
        Deep in the ocean lay.
        &lsquo;I ya longtemps que je t&rsquo;aime
        Jamais je ne t&rsquo;oublierai.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Angelique&rsquo;s heart grew suddenly heavy. From the rose-tree of the song her
      mind fled and shivered before the leafless rose-tree by the mine; and her
      old dread came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this was foolish of Angelique; of course the wise and great
      throw contumely on all such superstition; and knowing women will smile at
      each other meaningly, and with pity for a dull man-writer, and will
      whisper, &ldquo;Of course, the child.&rdquo; But many things, your majesties, are
      hidden from your wisdom and your greatness, and are given to the simple&mdash;to
      babes, and the mothers of babes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon this very night that Falding the Englishman sat with other men
      in a London tavern, talking joyously. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been the luck of Heaven,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;in the whole exploit. We&rsquo;d been prospecting for months. As a
      sort of try in a back-water we rowed over one night to an island and
      pitched tents. Not a dozen yards from where we camped was a
      rose-tree-think of it, Belgard, a rose-tree on a rag-tag island of Lake
      Superior! &lsquo;There&rsquo;s luck in odd numbers, says Rory O&rsquo;More.&rsquo; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s luck
      here,&rsquo; said I; and at it we went just beside the rose-tree. What&rsquo;s the
      result? Look at that prospectus: a company with a capital of two hundred
      thousand; the whole island in our hands in a week; and Antoine squatting
      on it now like Bonaparte on Elbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does Antoine get out of this&rdquo;? said Belgard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty dollars a month and his keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not write him off twenty shares to propitiate the gods&mdash;gifts
      unto the needy, eh!&mdash;a thousand-fold&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it might be done, Belgard, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But someone just then proposed the toast, &ldquo;The Rose Tree Mine!&rdquo; and the
      souls of these men waxed proud and merry, for they had seen the investor&rsquo;s
      palm filled with gold, the maker of conquest. While Antoine was singing
      with his wife, they were holding revel within the sound of Bow Bells. And
      far into the night, through silent Cheapside, a rolling voice swelled
      through much laughter thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Gai Ion la, gai le rosier,
          Du joli mois de Mai.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The next day there were heavy heads in London; but the next day, also, a
      man lay ill in the hut on the island of St. Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine had sung his last song. He had waked in the night with a start of
      pain, and by the time the sun was halting at noon above the Rose Tree
      Mine, he had begun a journey, the record of which no man has ever truly
      told, neither its beginning nor its end; because that which is of the
      spirit refuseth to be interpreted by the flesh. Some signs there be, but
      they are brief and shadowy; the awe of It is hidden in the mind of him
      that goeth out lonely unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the call goes forth, not wife nor child nor any other can hold the
      wayfarer back, though he may loiter for an instant on the brink. The poor
      medicaments which Angelique brings avail not; these soothing hands and
      healing tones, they pass through clouds of the middle place between heaven
      and earth to Antoine. It is only when the second midnight comes that, with
      conscious, but pensive and far-off, eyes, he says to her: &ldquo;Angelique, my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply her lips pressed his cheek, and her fingers hungered for his
      neck. Then: &ldquo;Is there pain now Antoine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no pain, Angelique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes slowly; her lips framed an ave. &ldquo;The mine,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;the mine&mdash;until the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Antoine, until the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you candles&mdash;many candles, Angelique?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many, my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ground is as iron; one cannot dig, and the water under the ice is
      cruel&mdash;is it not so, Angelique?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No axe could break the ground, and the water is cruel,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see my face until the winter is gone, my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head, but smoothed his hand meanwhile, and her throat was
      quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He partly slept&mdash;his body slept, though his mind was feeling its way
      to wonderful things. But near the morning his eyes opened wide, and he
      said: &ldquo;Someone calls out of the dark, Angelique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she, with her hand on her heart, replied: &ldquo;It is the cry of a dog,
      Antoine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are footsteps at the door, my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Antoine; it is the snow beating upon the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the sound of wings close by&mdash;dost thou not hear them,
      Angelique?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wings&mdash;wings,&rdquo; she falteringly said: &ldquo;it is the hot blast through
      the chimney; the night is cold, Antoine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night is very cold,&rdquo; he said; and he trembled... &ldquo;I hear, O my wife,
      I hear the voice of a little child... the voice is like thine, Angelique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she, not knowing what to reply, said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is hope in the voice of a child;&rdquo; and the mother stirred within
      her; and in the moment he knew also that the Spirits would give her the
      child in safety, that she should not be alone in the long winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds of the harsh night had ceased&mdash;the snapping of the
      leafless branches, the cracking of the earth, and the heaving of the
      rocks: the Spirits of the Frost had finished their work; and just as the
      grey forehead of dawn appeared beyond the cold hills, Antoine cried out
      gently: &ldquo;Angelique... Ah, mon Capitaine... Jesu&rdquo;... and then, no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night after night Angelique lighted candles in the place where Antoine
      smiled on in his frozen silence; and masses were said for his soul&mdash;the
      masses Love murmurs for its dead. The earth could not receive him; its
      bosom was adamant; but no decay could touch him; and she dwelt alone with
      this, that was her husband, until one beautiful, bitter day, when, with no
      eye save God&rsquo;s to see her, and no human comfort by her, she gave birth to
      a man-child. And yet that night she lighted the candles at the dead man&rsquo;s
      head and feet, dragging herself thither in the cold; and in her heart she
      said that the smile on Antoine&rsquo;s face was deeper than it had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early spring, when the earth painfully breathed away the frost that
      choked it, with her child for mourner, and herself for sexton and priest,
      she buried Antoine with maimed rites: but hers were the prayers of the
      poor, and of the pure in heart; and she did not fret because, in the hour
      that her comrade was put away into the dark, the world was laughing at the
      thought of coming summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before another sunrise, the owners of the island of St. Jean claimed what
      was theirs; and because that which had happened worked upon their hearts,
      they called the child St. Jean, and from that time forth they made him to
      enjoy the goodly fruits of the Rose Tree Mine.

    <h2>
      THE CIPHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hilton was staying his horse by a spring at Guidon Hill when he first saw
      her. She was gathering may-apples; her apron was full of them. He noticed
      that she did not stir until he rode almost upon her. Then she started,
      first without looking round, as does an animal, dropping her head slightly
      to one side, though not exactly appearing to listen. Suddenly she wheeled
      on him, and her big eyes captured him. The look bewildered him. She was a
      creature of singular fascination. Her face was expressive. Her eyes had
      wonderful light. She looked happy, yet grave withal; it was the gravity of
      an uncommon earnestness. She gazed through everything, and beyond. She was
      young&mdash;eighteen or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilton raised his hat, and courteously called a good-morning at her. She
      did not reply by any word, but nodded quaintly, and blinked seriously and
      yet blithely on him. He was preparing to dismount. As he did so he paused,
      astonished that she did not speak at all. Her face did not have a familiar
      language; its vocabulary was its own. He slid from his horse, and,
      throwing his arm over its neck as it stooped to the spring, looked at her
      more intently, but respectfully too. She did not yet stir, but there came
      into her face a slight inflection of confusion or perplexity. Again he
      raised his hat to her, and, smiling, wished her a good-morning. Even as he
      did so a thought sprung in him. Understanding gave place to wonder; he
      interpreted the unusual look in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he made a sign to her. To that her face responded with a
      wonderful speech&mdash;of relief and recognition. The corners of her apron
      dropped from her fingers, and the yellow may-apples fell about her feet.
      She did not notice this. She answered his sign with another, rapid,
      graceful, and meaning. He left his horse and advanced to her, holding out
      his hand simply&mdash;for he was a simple and honest man. Her response to
      this was spontaneous. The warmth of her fingers invaded him. Her eyes were
      full of questioning. He gave a hearty sign of admiration. She flushed with
      pleasure, but made a naive, protesting gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was deaf and dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilton had once a sister who was a mute. He knew that amazing primal
      gesture-language of the silent race, whom God has sent like one-winged
      birds into the world. He had watched in his sister just such looks of
      absolute nature as flashed from this girl. They were comrades on the
      instant; he reverential, gentle, protective; she sanguine, candid,
      beautifully aboriginal in the freshness of her cipher-thoughts. She saw
      the world naked, with a naked eye. She was utterly natural. She was the
      maker of exquisite, vital gesture-speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glided out from among the may-apples and the long, silken grass, to
      charm his horse with her hand. As she started to do so, he hastened to
      prevent her, but, utterly surprised, he saw the horse whinny to her cheek,
      and arch his neck under her white palm&mdash;it was very white. Then the
      animal&rsquo;s chin sought her shoulder and stayed placid. He had never done so
      to anyone before save Hilton. Once, indeed, he had kicked a stableman to
      death. He lifted his head and caught with playful shaking lips at her ear.
      Hilton smiled; and so, as we said, their comradeship began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a new officer of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company at Fort Guidon. She was
      the daughter of a ranchman. She had been educated by Father Corraine, the
      Jesuit missionary, Protestant though she was. He had learned the
      sign-language while assistant-priest in a Parisian chapel for mutes. He
      taught her this gesture-tongue, which she, taking, rendered divine; and,
      with this, she learned to read and write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida was faultless. Hilton was not; but no man is. To her, however, he was
      the best that man can be. He was unselfish and altogether honest, and that
      is much for a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pierre came to know of their friendship he shook his head doubtfully.
      One day he was sitting on the hot side of a pine near his mountain hut,
      soaking in the sun. He saw them passing below him, along the edge of the
      hill across the ravine. He said to someone behind him in the shade, who
      was looking also, &ldquo;What will be the end of that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the someone replied: &ldquo;Faith, what the Serpent in the Wilderness
      couldn&rsquo;t cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he&rsquo;ll play with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll do it without wishin&rsquo; or willin&rsquo;, maybe. It&rsquo;ll be a case of
      kiss and ride away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Soon Pierre pointed down again. She stood upon a green
      mound with a cool hedge of rock behind her, her feet on the margin of
      solid sunlight, her forehead bared. Her hair sprinkled round her as she
      gently threw back her head. Her face was full on Hilton. She was telling
      him something. Her gestures were rhythmical, and admirably balanced.
      Because they were continuous or only regularly broken, it was clear she
      was telling him a story. Hilton gravely, delightedly, nodded response now
      and then, or raised his eyebrows in fascinated surprise. Pierre, watching,
      was only aware of vague impressions&mdash;not any distinct outline of the
      tale. At last he guessed it as a perfect pastoral-birds, reaping, deer,
      winds, sundials, cattle, shepherds, hunting. To Hilton it was a new
      revelation. She was telling him things she had thought, she was recalling
      her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the last, she said in gesture: &ldquo;You can forget the winter, but not
      the spring. You like to remember the spring. It is the beginning. When the
      daisy first peeps, when the tall young deer first stands upon its feet,
      when the first egg is seen in the oriole&rsquo;s nest, when the sap first sweats
      from the tree, when you first look into the eye of your friend&mdash;these
      you want to remember....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused upon this gesture&mdash;a light touch upon the forehead, then
      the hands stretched out, palms upward, with coaxing fingers. She seemed
      lost in it. Her eyes rippled, her lips pressed slightly, a delicate wine
      crept through her cheek, and tenderness wimpled all. Her soft breast rose
      modestly to the cool texture of her dress. Hilton felt his blood bound
      joyfully; he had the wish of instant possession. But yet he could not
      stir, she held him so; for a change immediately passed upon her. She
      glided slowly from that almost statue-like repose into another gesture.
      Her eyes drew up from his, and looked away to plumbless distance, all
      glowing and childlike, and the new ciphers slowly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the spring dies away. We can only see a thing born once. And it may
      be ours, yet not ours. I have sighted the perfect Sharon-flower, far up on
      Guidon, yet it was not mine; it was too distant; I could not reach it. I
      have seen the silver bullfinch floating along the canon. I called to it,
      and it came singing; and it was mine, yet I could not hear its song, and I
      let it go; it could not be happy so with me.... I stand at the gate of a
      great city, and see all, and feel the great shuttles of sounds, the roar
      and clack of wheels, the horses&rsquo; hoofs striking the ground, the hammer of
      bells; all: and yet it is not mine; it is far, far away from me. It is one
      world, mine is another; and sometimes it is lonely, and the best things
      are not for me. But I have seen them, and it is pleasant to remember, and
      nothing can take from us the hour when things were born, when we saw the
      spring&mdash;nothing&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her manner of speech, as this went on, became exquisite in fineness,
      slower, and more dream-like, until, with downward protesting motions of
      the hand, she said that &ldquo;nothing&mdash;never!&rdquo; Then a great sigh surged up
      her throat, her lips parted slightly, showing the warm moist whiteness of
      her teeth, her hands falling lightly, drew together and folded in front of
      her. She stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre had watched this scene intently, his chin in his hands, his elbows
      on his knees. Presently he drew himself up, ran a finger meditatively
      along his lip, and said to himself: &ldquo;It is perfect. She is carved from the
      core of nature. But this thing has danger for her... &lsquo;bien!&rsquo;... ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A change in the scene before him caused this last expression of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilton, rousing from the enchanting pantomime, took a step towards her;
      but she raised her hand pleadingly, restrainingly, and he paused. With his
      eyes he asked her mutely why. She did not answer, but, all at once
      transformed into a thing of abundant sprightliness, ran down the hillside,
      tossing up her arms gaily. Yet her face was not all brilliance. Tears hung
      at her eyes. But Hilton did not see these. He did not run, but walked
      quickly, following her; and his face had a determined look. Immediately, a
      man rose up from behind a rock on the same side of the ravine, and shook
      clenched fists after the departing figures; then stood gesticulating
      angrily to himself, until, chancing to look up, he sighted Pierre, and
      straightway dived into the underbrush. Pierre rose to his feet, and said
      slowly: &ldquo;Hilton, here may be trouble for you also. It is a tangled world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening Pierre sauntered to the house of Ida&rsquo;s father. Light of
      footstep, he came upon the girl suddenly. They had always been friends
      since the day when, at uncommon risk, he rescued her dog from a freshet on
      the Wild Moose River. She was sitting utterly still, her hands folded in
      her lap. He struck his foot smartly on the ground. She felt the vibration,
      and looked up. He doffed his hat, and she held out her hand. He smiled and
      took it, and, as it lay in his, looked at it for a moment musingly. She
      drew it back slowly. He was then thinking that it was the most intelligent
      hand he had ever seen.... He determined to play a bold and surprising
      game. He had learned from her the alphabet of the fingers&mdash;that is,
      how to spell words. He knew little gesture-language. He, therefore,
      spelled slowly: &ldquo;Hawley is angry, because you love Hilton.&rdquo; The statement
      was so matter-of-fact, so sudden, that the girl had no chance. She flushed
      and then paled. She shook her head firmly, however, and her fingers slowly
      framed the reply: &ldquo;You guess too much. Foolish things come to the idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you this afternoon,&rdquo; he silently urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers trembled slightly. &ldquo;There was nothing to see.&rdquo; She knew he
      could not have read her gestures. &ldquo;I was telling a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ran from him&mdash;why?&rdquo; His questioning was cruel that he might in
      the end be kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child runs from its shadow, the bird from its nest, the fish jumps
      from the water&mdash;that is nothing.&rdquo; She had recovered somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he: &ldquo;The shadow follows the child, the bird comes back to its nest,
      the fish cannot live beyond the water. But it is sad when the child, in
      running, rushes into darkness, and loses its shadow; when the nest falls
      from the tree; and the hawk catches the happy fish.... Hawley saw you
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawley, like Ida, was deaf and dumb. He lived over the mountains, but came
      often. It had been understood that, one day, she should marry him. It
      seemed fitting. She had said neither yes nor no. And now?
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick tremor of trouble trailed over her face, then it became very
      still. Her eyes were bent upon the ground steadily. Presently a bird
      hopped near, its head coquetting at her. She ran her hand gently along the
      grass towards it. The bird tripped on it. She lifted it to her chin, at
      which it pecked tenderly. Pierre watched her keenly-admiring, pitying. He
      wished to serve her. At last, with a kiss upon its head, she gave it a
      light toss into the air, and it soared, lark-like, straight up, and
      hanging over her head, sang the day into the evening. Her eyes followed
      it. She could feel that it was singing. She smiled and lifted a finger
      lightly towards it. Then she spelled to Pierre this: &ldquo;It is singing to me.
      We imperfect things love each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about loving Hawley, then&rdquo;? Pierre persisted. She did not reply,
      but a strange look came upon her, and in the pause Hilton came from the
      house and stood beside them. At this, Pierre lighted a cigarette, and with
      a good-natured nod to Hilton, walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilton stooped over her, pale and eager. &ldquo;Ida,&rdquo; he gestured, &ldquo;will you
      answer me now? Will you be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself together with a little shiver. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was her steady
      reply. She ruled her face into stillness, so that it showed nothing of
      what she felt. She came to her feet wearily, and drawing down a cool
      flowering branch of chestnut, pressed it to her cheek. &ldquo;You do not love
      me&rdquo;? he asked nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to marry Luke Hawley,&rdquo; was her slow answer. She spelled the
      words. She used no gesture to that. The fact looked terribly hard and
      inflexible so. Hilton was not a vain man, and he believed he was not
      loved. His heart crowded to his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go away, now,&rdquo; she begged with an anxious gesture. While the hand
      was extended, he reached and brought it to his lips, then quickly kissed
      her on the forehead, and walked away. She stood trembling, and as the
      fingers of one hand hung at her side, they spelled mechanically these
      words: &ldquo;It would spoil his life. I am only a mute&mdash;a dummy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she stood so, she felt the approach of someone. She did not turn
      instantly, but with the aboriginal instinct, listened, as it were, with
      her body; but presently faced about&mdash;to Hawley. He was red with
      anger. He had seen Hilton kiss her. He caught her smartly by the arm, but,
      awed by the great calmness of her face, dropped it, and fell into a fit of
      sullenness. She spoke to him: he did not reply. She touched his arm: he
      still was gloomy. All at once the full price of her sacrifice rushed upon
      her; and overpowered her. She had no help at her critical hour, not even
      from this man she had intended to bless. There came a swift revulsion, all
      passions stormed in her at once. Despair was the resultant of these
      forces. She swerved from him immediately, and ran hard towards the
      high-banked river!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawley did not follow her at once: he did not guess her purpose. She had
      almost reached the leaping-place, when Pierre shot from the trees, and
      seized her. The impulse of this was so strong, that they slipped, and
      quivered on the precipitous edge: but Pierre righted then, and presently
      they were safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre held her hard by both wrists for a moment. Then, drawing her away,
      he loosed her, and spelled these words slowly: &ldquo;I understand. But you are
      wrong. Hawley is not the man. You must come with me. It is foolish to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The riot of her feelings, her momentary despair, were gone. It was even
      pleasant to be mastered by Pierre&rsquo;s firmness. She was passive.
      Mechanically she went with him. Hawley approached. She looked at Pierre.
      Then she turned on the other. &ldquo;Yours is not the best love,&rdquo; she signed to
      him; &ldquo;it does not trust; it is selfish.&rdquo; And she moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, an hour later, Hilton caught her to his bosom, and kissed her full on
      the lips.... And his right to do so continues to this day.

    <h2>
      A TRAGEDY OF NOBODIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Fort Latrobe sentiment was not of the most refined kind. Local customs
      were pronounced and crude in outline; language was often highly coloured,
      and action was occasionally accentuated by a pistol shot. For the first
      few months of its life the place was honoured by the presence of neither
      wife, nor sister, nor mother. Yet women lived there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When some men did bring wives and children, it was noticed that the girl
      Blanche was seldom seen in the streets. And, however it was, there grew
      among the men a faint respect for her. They did not talk of it to each
      other, but it existed. It was known that Blanche resented even the most
      casual notice from those men who had wives and homes. She gave the
      impression that she had a remnant of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; she said to Harry Delong, who asked her to drink with him on
      New Year&rsquo;s Day. &ldquo;Go home, and thank God that you&rsquo;ve got a home&mdash;and a
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Jacques, the long-time friend of Pretty Pierre, came to Fort
      Latrobe, with his sulky eye and scrupulously neat attire, Blanche appeared
      to withdraw still more from public gaze, though no one saw any connection
      between these events. The girl also became fastidious in her dress, and
      lost all her former dash and smart aggression of manner. She shrank from
      the women of her class, for which, as might be expected, she was duly
      reviled. But the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,
      nor has it been written that a woman may not close her ears, and bury
      herself in darkness, and travel alone in the desert with her people&mdash;those
      ghosts of herself, whose name is legion, and whose slow white fingers mock
      more than the world dare at its worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, she was found behind the bar of Weir&rsquo;s Tavern at Cedar Point,
      the resort most frequented by Jacques. Word went about among the men that
      Blanche was taking a turn at religion, or, otherwise, reformation. Soldier
      Joe was something sceptical on this point from the fact that she had
      developed a very uncertain temper. This appeared especially noticeable in
      her treatment of Jacques. She made him the target for her sharpest
      sarcasm. Though a peculiar glow came to his eyes at times, he was never
      roused from his exasperating coolness. When her shafts were unusually
      direct and biting, and the temptation to resent was keen, he merely
      shrugged his shoulders, almost gently, and said: &ldquo;Eh, such women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there were men at Fort Latrobe who prophesied trouble, for
      they knew there was a deep strain of malice in the French half-breed which
      could be the more deadly because of its rare use. He was not easily moved,
      he viewed life from the heights of a philosophy which could separate the
      petty from the prodigious. His reputation was not wholly disquieting; he
      was of the goats, he had sometimes been found with the sheep, he preferred
      to be numbered with the transgressors. Like Pierre, his one passion was
      gambling. There were legends that once or twice in his life he had had
      another passion, but that some Gorgon drew out his heartstrings painfully,
      one by one, and left him inhabited by a pale spirit now called Irony, now
      Indifference&mdash;under either name a fret and an anger to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Blanche&rsquo;s attacks on Jacques called out anxious protests from men
      like rollicking Soldier Joe, who said to her one night, &ldquo;Blanche, there&rsquo;s
      a devil in Jacques. Some day you&rsquo;ll startle him, and then he&rsquo;ll shoot you
      as cool as he empties the pockets of Freddy Tarlton over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Blanche replied: &ldquo;When he does that, what will you do, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Do?&rdquo; The man stroked his beard softly. &ldquo;Why, give him ditto&mdash;cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there&rsquo;s nothing to row about, is there?&rdquo; And Soldier Joe was
      not on the instant clever enough to answer her sophistry; but when she
      left him and he had thought awhile, he said, convincingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where would you be then, Blanche?... That&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One thing was known and certain: Blanche was earning her living by honest,
      if not high-class, labour. Weir the tavern-keeper said she was &ldquo;worth
      hundreds&rdquo; to him. But she grew pale, her eyes became peculiarly brilliant,
      her voice took a lower key, and lost a kind of hoarseness it had in the
      past. Men came in at times merely to have a joke at her expense, having
      heard of her new life; but they failed to enjoy their own attempts at
      humour. Women of her class came also, some with half-uncertain jibes, some
      with a curious wistfulness, and a few with scornful oaths; but the jibes
      and oaths were only for a time. It became known that she had paid the
      coach fare of Miss Dido (as she was called) to the hospital at Wapiti, and
      had raised a subscription for her maintenance there, heading it herself
      with a liberal sum. Then the atmosphere round her became less trying; yet
      her temper remained changeable, and had it not been that she was
      good-looking and witty, her position might have been insecure. As it was,
      she ruled in a neutral territory where she was the only woman. One night,
      after an inclement remark to Jacques, in the card-room, Blanche came back
      to the bar, and not noticing that, while she was gone, Soldier Joe had
      entered and laid himself down on a bench in a corner, she threw her head
      passionately forward on her arms as they rested on the counter, and cried:
      &ldquo;O my God! my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soldier Joe lay still as if sleeping, and when Blanche was called away
      again he rose, stole out, went down to Freddy Tarlton&rsquo;s office, and
      offered to bet Freddy two to one that Blanche wouldn&rsquo;t live a year. Joe&rsquo;s
      experience of women was limited. He had in his mind the case of a girl who
      had accidentally smothered her child; and so he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blanche has something on her mind that&rsquo;s killing her, Freddy. When
      trouble fixes on her sort it kills swift and sure. They&rsquo;ve nothing to live
      for but life, and it isn&rsquo;t good enough, you see, for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo; Joe
      paused to find out where his philosophy was taking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freddy Tarlton finished the sentence for him: &ldquo;For an inner sorrow is a
      consuming fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort Latrobe soon had an unexpected opportunity to study Soldier Joe&rsquo;s
      theory. One night Jacques did not appear at Weir&rsquo;s Tavern as he had
      engaged to do, and Soldier Joe and another went across the frozen river to
      his log-hut to seek him. They found him by a handful of fire, breathing
      heavily and nearly unconscious. One of the sudden and frequently fatal
      colds of the mountains had fastened on him, and he had begun a war for
      life. Joe started back at once for liquor and a doctor, leaving his
      comrade to watch by the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not understand why Blanche should stagger and grow white when he
      told her; nor why she insisted on taking the liquor herself. He did not
      yet guess the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day all Fort Latrobe knew that Blanche was nursing Jacques, on
      what was thought to be his no-return journey. The doctor said it was a
      dangerous case, and he held out little hope. Nursing might bring him
      through, but the chance was very slight. Blanche only occasionally left
      the sick man&rsquo;s bedside to be relieved by Soldier Joe and Freddy Tarlton.
      It dawned on Joe at last, it had dawned on Freddy before, what Blanche
      meant by the heart-breaking words uttered that night in Weir&rsquo;s Tavern.
      Down through the crust of this woman&rsquo;s heart had gone something both
      joyful and painful. Whatever it was, it made Blanche a saving nurse, a
      good apothecary; for, one night the doctor pronounced Jacques out of
      danger, and said that a few days would bring him round if he was careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, Jacques fully comprehended all Blanche had done
      for him, though he had ceased to wonder at her changed attitude to him.
      Through his suffering and his delirium had come the understanding of it.
      When, after the crisis, the doctor turned away from the bed, Jacques
      looked steadily into Blanche&rsquo;s eyes, and she flushed, and wiped the wet
      from his brow with her handkerchief. He took the handkerchief from her
      fingers gently before Soldier Joe came over to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had insisted that Blanche should go to Weir&rsquo;s Tavern and get
      the night&rsquo;s rest, needed so much, and Joe now pressed her to keep her
      promise. Jacques added an urging word, and after a time she started. Joe
      had forgotten to tell her that a new road had been made on the ice since
      she had crossed, and that the old road was dangerous. Wandering with her
      thoughts she did not notice the spruce bushes set up for signal, until she
      had stepped on a thin piece of ice. It bent beneath her. She slipped:
      there was a sudden sinking, a sharp cry, then another, piercing and
      hopeless&mdash;and it was the one word&mdash;&ldquo;Jacques!&rdquo; Then the night was
      silent as before. But someone had heard the cry. Freddy Tarlton was
      crossing the ice also, and that desolating Jacques! had reached his ears.
      When he found her he saw that she had been taken and the other left. But
      that other, asleep in his bed at the sacred moment when she parted,
      suddenly waked, and said to Soldier Joe: &ldquo;Did you speak, Joe? Did you call
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Joe, who had been playing cards with himself, replied, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said
      a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jacques then added: &ldquo;Perhaps I dream&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the advice of the doctor and Freddy Tarlton, the bad news was kept from
      Jacques. When she did not come the next day, Joe told him that she
      couldn&rsquo;t; that he ought to remember she had had no rest for weeks, and had
      earned a long rest. And Jacques said that was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weir began preparations for the funeral, but Freddy Tarlton took them out
      of his hands&mdash;Freddy Tarlton, who visited at the homes of Fort
      Latrobe. But he had the strength of his convictions such as they were. He
      began by riding thirty miles and back to ask the young clergyman at Purple
      Hill to come and bury Blanche. She&rsquo;d reformed and been baptised, Freddy
      said with a sad sort of humour. And the clergyman, when he knew all, said
      that he would come. Freddy was hardly prepared for what occurred when he
      got back. Men were waiting for him, anxious to know if the clergyman was
      coming. They had raised a subscription to cover the cost of the funeral,
      and among them were men such as Harry Delong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows had better not mix yourselves up in this,&rdquo; said Freddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harry Delong replied quickly: &ldquo;I am going to see the thing through.&rdquo;
       And the others endorsed his words. When the clergyman came, and looked at
      the face of this Magdalene, he was struck by its comeliness and quiet. All
      else seemed to have been washed away. On her breast lay a knot of white
      roses&mdash;white roses in this winter desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      One man present, seeing the look of wonder in the clergyman&rsquo;s eyes, said
      quietly: &ldquo;My&mdash;my wife sent them. She brought the plant from Quebec.
      It has just bloomed. She knows all about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That man was Harry Delong. The keeper of his home understood the other
      homeless woman. When she knew of Blanche&rsquo;s death she said: &ldquo;Poor girl,
      poor girl!&rdquo; and then she had gently added, &ldquo;Poor Jacques!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jacques, as he sat in a chair by the fire four days after the tragedy,
      did not know that the clergyman was reading over a grave on the hillside,
      words which are for the hearts of the quick as for the untenanted dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jacques&rsquo;s inquiries after Blanche, Soldier Joe had made changing and
      vague replies. At last he said that she was ill; then, that she was very
      ill, and again, that she was better, almighty better&mdash;now. The third
      day following the funeral, Jacques insisted that he would go and see her.
      The doctor at length decided he should be taken to Weir&rsquo;s Tavern, where,
      they declared, they would tell him all. And they took him, and placed him
      by the fire in the card-room, a wasted figure, but fastidious in manner
      and scrupulously neat in person as of old. Then he asked for Blanche; but
      even now they had not the courage for it. The doctor nervously went out,
      as if to seek her; and Freddy Tarlton said, &ldquo;Jacques, let us have a little
      game, just for quarters, you know. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other replied without eagerness: &ldquo;Voila, one game, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drew him to the table, but he played listlessly. His eyes shifted
      ever to the door. Luck was against him. Finally he pushed over a silver
      piece, and said: &ldquo;The last. My money is all gone. &lsquo;Bien!&rsquo;&rdquo; He lost that
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door opened, and a ranchman from Purple Hill entered. He
      looked carelessly round, and then said loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Joe, so you&rsquo;ve buried Blanche, have you? Poor old girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a heavy silence. No one replied. Jacques started to his feet,
      gazed around searchingly, painfully, and presently gave a great gasp. His
      hands made a chafing motion in the air, and then blood showed on his lips
      and chin. He drew a handkerchief from his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon!... Pardon!&rdquo; he faintly cried in apology, and put it to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he fell backwards in the arms of Soldier Joe, who wiped a moisture
      from the lifeless cheek as he laid the body on a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner of the stained handkerchief they found the word,
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche.

    <h2>
      A SANCTUARY OF THE PLAINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Father Corraine stood with his chin in his hand and one arm supporting the
      other, thinking deeply. His eyes were fixed on the northern horizon, along
      which the sun was casting oblique rays; for it was the beginning of the
      winter season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the prairie touched the sun it was responsive and radiant; but on
      either side of this red and golden tapestry there was a tawny glow and
      then a duskiness which, curving round to the north and east, became blue
      and cold&mdash;an impalpable but perceptible barrier rising from the
      earth, and shutting in Father Corraine like a prison wall. And this shadow
      crept stealthily on and invaded the whole circle, until, where the
      radiance had been, there was one continuous wall of gloom, rising are upon
      are to invasion of the zenith, and pierced only by some intrusive
      wandering stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still the priest stood there looking, until the darkness closed down
      on him with an almost tangible consistency. Then he appeared to remember
      himself, and turned away with a gentle remonstrance of his head, and
      entered the hut behind him. He lighted a lamp, looked at it doubtfully,
      blew it out, set it aside, and lighted a candle. This he set in the one
      window of the room which faced the north and west.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to a door opening into the only other room in the hut, and with
      his hand on the latch looked thoughtfully and sorrowfully at something in
      the corner of the room where he stood. He was evidently debating upon some
      matter,&mdash;probably the removal of what was in the corner to the other
      room. If so, he finally decided to abandon the intention. He sat down in a
      chair, faced the candle, again dropped his chin upon his hand, and kept
      his eyes musingly on the light. He was silent and motionless a long time,
      then his lips moved, and he seemed to repeat something to himself in
      whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he took a well-worn book from his pocket, and read aloud from it
      softly what seemed to be an office of his Church. His voice grew slightly
      louder as he continued, until, suddenly, there ran through the words a
      deep sigh which did not come from himself. He raised his head quickly,
      started to his feet, and turning round, looked at that something in the
      corner. It took the form of a human figure, which raised itself on an
      elbow and said: &ldquo;Water&mdash;water&mdash;for the love of God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Corraine stood painfully staring at the figure for a moment, and
      then the words broke from him &ldquo;Not dead&mdash;not dead&mdash;wonderful!&rdquo;
       Then he stepped quickly to a table, took therefrom a pannikin of water,
      and kneeling, held it to the lips of the gasping figure of a woman,
      throwing his arm round the shoulder, and supporting the head on his
      breast. Again he spoke &ldquo;Alive&mdash;alive! Blessed be Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the woman seized the hand of the priest, which held the
      pannikin, and kissed it, saying faintly: &ldquo;You are good to me.... But I
      must sleep&mdash;I must sleep&mdash;I am so tired; and I&rsquo;ve&mdash;very far&mdash;to
      go&mdash;across the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said very slowly, then the head thick with brown curls dropped
      again on the priest&rsquo;s breast, heavy with sleep. Father Corraine, flushing
      slightly at first, became now slightly pale, and his brow was a place of
      war between thankfulness and perplexity. But he said something
      prayerfully, then closed his lips firmly, and gently laid the figure down,
      where it was immediately clothed about with slumber. Then he rose, and
      standing with his eyes bent upon the sleeper and his fingers clasping each
      other tightly before him, said: &ldquo;Poor girl! So, she is alive. And now what
      will come of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his grey head in doubt, and immediately began to prepare some
      simple food and refreshment for the sufferer when she should awake. In the
      midst of doing so he paused and repeated the words, &ldquo;And what will come of
      it?&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;There was no sign of pulse nor heart-beat when I
      found her. But life hides itself where man cannot reach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having finished his task, he sat down, drew the book of holy offices again
      from his bosom, and read it, whisperingly, for a time; then fell to
      musing, and, after a considerable time, knelt down as if in prayer. While
      he knelt, the girl, as if startled from her sleep by some inner shock,
      opened her eyes wide and looked at him, first with bewilderment, then with
      anxiety, then with wistful thankfulness. &ldquo;Oh, I thought&mdash;I thought
      when I awoke before that it was a woman. But it is the good Father
      Corraine&mdash;Corraine, yes, that was the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s clean-shaven face, long hair, and black cassock had, in her
      first moments of consciousness, deceived her. Now a sharp pain brought a
      moan to her lips; and this drew the priest&rsquo;s attention. He rose, and
      brought her some food and drink. &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must take
      these.&rdquo; Something in her face touched his sensitive mind, and he said,
      solemnly: &ldquo;You are alone with me and God, this hour. Be at peace. Eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes swam with instant tears. &ldquo;I know&mdash;I am alone&mdash;with
      God,&rdquo; she said. Again he gently urged the food upon her, and she took a
      little; but now and then she put her hand to her side as if in pain. And
      once, as she did so, she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve far to go and the pain is bad. Did
      they take him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Corraine shook his head. &ldquo;I do not know of whom you speak,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;When I went to my door this morning I found you lying there. I
      brought you in, and, finding no sign of life in you, sent Featherfoot, my
      Indian, to Fort Cypress for a trooper to come; for I feared that there had
      been ill done to you, somehow. This border-side is but a rough country. It
      is not always safe for a woman to travel alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shuddered. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;Father Corraine, I believe you
      are?&rdquo; (Here the priest bowed his head.) &ldquo;I wish to tell you all, so that
      if ever any evil did come to me, if I should die without doin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s in
      my heart to do, you would know, and would tell him if you ever saw him,
      how I remembered, and kept rememberin&rsquo; him always, till my heart got sick
      with waitin&rsquo;, and I came to find him far across the seas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your tale, my child,&rdquo; he patiently said. Her eyes were on the
      candle in the window questioningly. &ldquo;It is for the trooper&mdash;to guide
      him,&rdquo; the other remarked. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis past time that he should be here. When you
      are able you can go with him to the Fort. You will be better cared for
      there, and will be among women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&mdash;the man who was kind to me&mdash;I wish I knew of him,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for your story, my child. Speak of your trouble, whether it
      be of the mind and body, or of the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge if it be of the soul,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from far away. I lived in old Donegal since the day that I was
      born there, and I had a lover, as brave and true a lad as ever trod the
      world. But sorrow came. One night at Farcalladen Rise there was a crack of
      arms and a clatter of fleeing hoofs, and he that I loved came to me and
      said a quick word of partin&rsquo;, and with a kiss&mdash;it&rsquo;s burnin&rsquo; on my
      lips yet&mdash;askin&rsquo; pardon, father, for speech of this to you&mdash;and
      he was gone, an outlaw, to Australia. For a time word came from him. Then
      I was taken ill and couldn&rsquo;t answer his letters, and a cousin of my own,
      who had tried to win my love, did a wicked thing. He wrote a letter to him
      and told him I was dyin&rsquo;, and that there was no use of farther words from
      him. And never again did word come to me from him. But I waited, my heart
      sick with longin&rsquo; and full of hate for the memory of the man who, when
      struck with death, told me of the cruel deed he had done between us two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, as she had to do several times during the recital, through
      weariness or pain; but, after a moment, proceeded. &ldquo;One day, one beautiful
      day, when the flowers were like love to the eye, and the larks singin&rsquo; 
      overhead, and my thoughts goin&rsquo; with them as they swam until they were
      lost in the sky, and every one of them a prayer for the lad livin&rsquo; yet, as
      I hoped, somewhere in God&rsquo;s universe&mdash;there rode a gentleman down
      Farcalladen Rise. He stopped me as I walked, and said a kind good-day to
      me; and I knew when I looked into his face that he had word for me&mdash;the
      whisperin&rsquo; of some angel, I suppose, and I said to him as though he had
      asked me for it, &lsquo;My name is Mary Callen, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that he started, and the colour came quick to his face; and he said:
      &lsquo;I am Sir Duke Lawless. I come to look for Mary Callen&rsquo;s grave. Is there a
      Mary Callen dead, and a Mary Callen livin&rsquo;? and did both of them love a
      man that went from Farcalladen Rise one wild night long ago?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s but one Mary Callen,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but the heart of me is dead,
      until I hear news that brings it to life again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And no man calls you wife?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No man, Sir Duke Lawless,&rsquo; answered I. &lsquo;And no man ever could, save him
      that used to write me of you from the heart of Australia; only there was
      no Sir to your name then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to that since,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, tell me,&rsquo; I cried, with a quiverin&rsquo; at my heart, &lsquo;tell me, is he
      livin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he replied: &lsquo;I left him in the Pipi Valley of the Rocky Mountains a
      year ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A year ago!&rsquo; said I, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed that I&rsquo;ve been so long in comin&rsquo; here,&rsquo; replied he; &lsquo;but, of
      course, he didn&rsquo;t know that you were alive, and I had been parted from a
      lady for years&mdash;a lover&rsquo;s quarrel&mdash;and I had to choose between
      courtin&rsquo; her again and marryin&rsquo; her, or comin&rsquo; to Farcalladen Rise at
      once. Well, I went to the altar first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, sir, you&rsquo;ve come with the speed of the wind, for now that I&rsquo;ve news
      of him, it is only yesterday that he went away, not years agone. But tell
      me, does he ever think of me?&rsquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He thinks of you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as one for whom the masses for the dead are
      spoken; but while I knew him, first and last, the memory of you was with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that he got off his horse, and said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll walk with you to his
      father&rsquo;s home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not do that,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;for it&rsquo;s level with the ground. God
      punish them that did it! And they&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo; in the glen by the stream that
      he loved and galloped over many a time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They are dead&mdash;they are dead, then,&rsquo; said he, with his bridle swung
      loose on his arm and his hat off reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gone home to Heaven together,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;one day and one hour, and a
      prayer on their lips for the lad; and I closin&rsquo; their eyes at the last.
      And before they went they made me sit by them and sing a song that&rsquo;s
      common here with us; for manny and manny of the strength and pride of
      Farcalladen Rise have sailed the wide seas north and south, and
      otherwhere, and comin&rsquo; back maybe and maybe not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hark,&rsquo; he said, very gravely, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, for I&rsquo;ve
      heard him sing it, I know, in the worst days and the best days that ever
      we had, when luck was wicked and big against us and we starvin&rsquo; on the
      wallaby track; or when we found the turn in the lane to brighter days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then with me lookin&rsquo; at him full in the eyes, gentleman though he
      was,&mdash;for comrade he had been with the man I loved,&mdash;he said to
      me there, so finely and kindly, it ought to have brought the dead back
      from their graves to hear, these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll travel far and wide, dear, but you&rsquo;ll come back again,
   You&rsquo;ll come back to your father and your mother in the glen,
   Although we should be lyin&rsquo; &lsquo;neath the heather grasses then
   You&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo; back, my darlin&rsquo;!&rsquo; 

   &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see the icebergs sailin&rsquo; along the wintry foam,
   The white hair of the breakers, and the wild swans as they roam;
   But you&rsquo;ll not forget the rowan beside your father&rsquo;s home&mdash;
   You&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo; back, my darlin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here the girl paused longer than usual, and the priest dropped his
      forehead in his hand sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought grief to your kind heart, father,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;not sorrow at all; but I was born on the Liffey
      side, though it&rsquo;s forty years and more since I left it, and I&rsquo;m an old man
      now. That song I knew well, and the truth and the heart of it too. ... I
      am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, together we went to the grave of the father and mother, and the
      place where the home had been, and for a long time he was silent, as
      though they who slept beneath the sod were his, and not another&rsquo;s; but at
      last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And what will you do? I don&rsquo;t quite know where he is, though; when last
      I heard from him and his comrades, they were in the Pipi Valley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart was full of joy; for though I saw how touched he was because of
      what he saw, it was all common to my sight, and I had grieved much, but
      had had little delight; and I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to be done. He cannot come back here, and I must
      go to him&mdash;that is,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you think he cares for me still,&mdash;for
      my heart quakes at the thought that he might have changed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know his heart,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll find him, I doubt not, the same,
      though he buried you long ago in a lonely tomb,&mdash;the tomb of a sweet
      remembrance, where the flowers are everlastin&rsquo;.&rsquo; Then after more words he
      offered me money with which to go; but I said to him that the love that
      couldn&rsquo;t carry itself across the sea by the strength of the hands and the
      sweat of the brow was no love at all; and that the harder was the road to
      him the gladder I&rsquo;d be, so that it didn&rsquo;t keep me too long, and brought me
      to him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked me up and down very earnestly for a minute, and then he said:
      &lsquo;What is there under the roof of heaven like the love of an honest woman!
      It makes the world worth livin&rsquo; in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;when love has hope, and a place to lay its head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Take this,&rsquo; said he&mdash;and he drew from his pocket his watch&mdash;&lsquo;and
      carry it to him with the regard of Duke Lawless, and this for yourself&rsquo;&mdash;fetching
      from his pocket a revolver and putting it into my hands; &lsquo;for the prairies
      are but rough places after all, and it&rsquo;s better to be safe than&mdash;worried....
      Never fear though but the prairies will bring back the finest of blooms to
      your cheek, if fair enough it is now, and flush his eye with pride of you;
      and God be with you both, if a sinner may say that, and breakin&rsquo; no
      saint&rsquo;s prerogative.&rsquo; And he mounted to ride away, havin&rsquo; shaken my hand
      like a brother; but he turned again before he went, and said: &lsquo;Tell him
      and his comrades that I&rsquo;ll shoulder my gun and join them before the world
      is a year older, if I can. For that land is God&rsquo;s land, and its people are
      my people, and I care not who knows it, whatever here I be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I worked my way across the sea, and stayed awhile in the East earning
      money to carry me over the land and into the Pipi Valley. I joined a party
      of emigrants that were goin&rsquo; westward, and travelled far with them. But
      they quarrelled and separated, I goin&rsquo; with these that I liked best. One
      night though, I took my horse and left; for I knew there was evil in the
      heart of a man who sought me continually, and the thing drove me mad. I
      rode until my horse could stumble no farther, and then I took the saddle
      for a pillow and slept on the bare ground. And in the morning I got up and
      rode on, seein&rsquo; no house nor human being for manny and manny a mile. When
      everything seemed hopeless I came suddenly upon a camp. But I saw that
      there was only one man there, and I should have turned back, but that I
      was worn and ill, and, moreover, I had ridden almost upon him. But he was
      kind. He shared his food with me, and asked me where I was goin&rsquo;. I told
      him, and also that I had quarrelled with those of my party and had left
      them nothing more. He seemed to wonder that I was goin&rsquo; to Pipi Valley;
      and when I had finished my tale he said: &lsquo;Well, I must tell you that I am
      not good company for you. I have a name that doesn&rsquo;t pass at par up here.
      To speak plain truth, troopers are looking for me, and&mdash;strange as it
      may be&mdash;for a crime which I didn&rsquo;t commit. That is the foolishness of
      the law. But for this I&rsquo;m making for the American border, beyond which,
      treaty or no treaty, a man gets refuge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was silent after that, lookin&rsquo; at me thoughtfully the while, but in a
      way that told me I might trust him, evil though he called himself. At
      length he said: &lsquo;I know a good priest, Father Corraine, who has a cabin
      sixty miles or more from here, and I&rsquo;ll guide you to him, if so be you can
      trust a half-breed and a gambler, and one men call an outlaw. If not, I&rsquo;m
      feared it&rsquo;ll go hard with you; for the Cypress Hills are not easy travel,
      as I&rsquo;ve known this many a year. And should you want a name to call me,
      Pretty Pierre will do, though my godfathers and godmothers did different
      for me before they went to Heaven.&rsquo; And nothing said he irreverently,
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the priest looked up and answered: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know him well&mdash;an
      evil man, and yet he has suffered too... Well, well, my daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that he took his pistol from his pocket and handed it. &lsquo;Take that,&rsquo; he
      said. &lsquo;It will make you safer with me, and I&rsquo;ll ride ahead of you, and we
      shall reach there by sundown, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I would not take his pistol, but, shamed a little, showed him the one
      Sir Duke Lawless gave me. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and, maybe, it&rsquo;s
      better that I should carry mine, for, as I said, there are anxious
      gentlemen lookin&rsquo; for me, who wish to give me a quiet but dreary home. And
      see,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;if they should come you will be safe, for they sit in the
      judgment seat, and the statutes hang at their saddles, and I&rsquo;ll say this
      for them, that a woman to them is as a saint of God out here where women
      and saints are few.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not speak as he spoke, for his words had a turn of French; but I
      knew that, whatever he was, I should travel peaceably with him. Yet I saw
      that he would be runnin&rsquo; the risk of his own safety for me, and I told him
      that I could not have him do it; but he talked me lightly down, and we
      started. We had gone but a little distance, when there galloped over a
      ridge upon us, two men of the party I had left, and one, I saw, was the
      man I hated; and I cried out and told Pretty Pierre. He wheeled his horse,
      and held his pistol by him. They said that I should come with them, and
      they told a dreadful lie&mdash;that I was a runaway wife; but Pierre
      answered them they lied. At this, one rode forward suddenly, and clutched
      me at my waist to drag me from my horse. At this, Pierre&rsquo;s pistol was
      thrust in his face, and Pierre bade him cease, which he did; but the other
      came down with a pistol showin&rsquo;, and Pierre, seein&rsquo; they were determined,
      fired; and the man that clutched at me fell from his horse. Then the other
      drew off; and Pierre got down, and stooped, and felt the man&rsquo;s heart, and
      said to the other: &lsquo;Take your friend away, for he is dead; but drop that
      pistol of yours on the ground first.&rsquo; And the man did so; and Pierre, as
      he looked at the dead man, added: &lsquo;Why did he make me kill him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the two tied the body to the horse, and the man rode away with it.
      We travelled on without speakin&rsquo; for a long time, and then I heard him say
      absently: &lsquo;I am sick of that. When once you have played shuttlecock with
      human life, you have to play it to the end&mdash;that is the penalty. But
      a woman is a woman, and she must be protected.&rsquo; Then afterward he turned
      and asked me if I had friends in Pipi Valley; and because what he had done
      for me had worked upon me, I told him of the man I was goin&rsquo; to find. And
      he started in his saddle, and I could see by the way he twisted the mouth
      of his horse that I had stirred him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the priest interposed: &ldquo;What is the name of the man in Pipi Valley to
      whom you are going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the girl replied: &ldquo;Ah, father, have I not told you? It is Shon McGann&mdash;of
      Farcalladen Rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Father Corraine seemed suddenly troubled, and he looked strangely
      and sadly at her. But the girl&rsquo;s eyes were fastened on the candle in the
      window, as if she saw her story in it; and she continued: &ldquo;A colour spread
      upon him, and then left him pale; and he said: &lsquo;To Shon McGann&mdash;you
      are going to him? Think of that&mdash;that!&rsquo; For an instant I thought a
      horrible smile played upon his face, and I grew frightened, and said to
      him: &lsquo;You know him. You are not sorry that you are helping me? You and
      Shon McGann are not enemies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a moment the smile that struck me with dread passed, and he said,
      as he drew himself up with a shake: &lsquo;Shon McGann and I were good
      friends-as good as ever shared a blanket or split a loaf, though he was
      free of any evil, and I failed of any good.... Well, there came a change.
      We parted. We could meet no more; but who could have guessed this thing?
      Yet, hear me&mdash;I am no enemy of Shon McGann, as let my deeds to you
      prove.&rsquo; And he paused again, but added presently: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s better you should
      have come now than two years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had a fear in my heart, and to this asked him why. &lsquo;Because then he
      was a friend of mine,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and ill always comes to those who are
      such.&rsquo; I was troubled at this, and asked him if Shon was in Pipi Valley
      yet. &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for I&rsquo;ve travelled long and far from
      there; still, while I do not wish to put doubt into your mind, I have a
      thought he may be gone.... He had a gay heart,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;and we saw
      brave days together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And though I questioned him, he told me little more, but became silent,
      scannin&rsquo; the plains as we rode; but once or twice he looked at me in a
      strange fashion, and passed his hand across his forehead, and a grey look
      came upon his face. I asked him if he was not well. &lsquo;Only a kind of
      fightin&rsquo; within,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;such things soon pass, and it is well they do,
      or we should break to pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I said again that I wished not to bring him into danger. And he
      replied that these matters were accordin&rsquo; to Fate; that men like him must
      go on when once the die is cast, for they cannot turn back. It seemed to
      me a bitter creed, and I was sorry for him. Then for hours we kept an
      almost steady silence, and comin&rsquo; at last to the top of a rise of land he
      pointed to a spot far off on the plains, and said that you, father, lived
      there; and that he would go with me still a little way, and then leave me.
      I urged him to go at once, but he would not, and we came down into the
      plains. He had not ridden far when he said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Riders of the Plains, those gentlemen who seek me, are there&mdash;see!
      Ride on or stay, which you please. If you go you will reach the priest, if
      you stay here where I shall leave you, you will see me taken perhaps, and
      it may be fightin&rsquo; or death; but you will be safe with them. On the whole,
      it is best, perhaps, that you should ride away to the priest. They might
      not believe all that you told them, ridin&rsquo; with me as you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think a sudden madness again came upon me. Rememberin&rsquo; what things
      were done by women for refugees in old Donegal, and that this man had
      risked his life for me, I swung my horse round nose and nose with his, and
      drew my revolver, and said that I should see whatever came to him. He
      prayed me not to do so wild a thing; but when I refused, and pushed on
      along with him, makin&rsquo; at an angle for some wooded hills, I saw that a
      smile played upon his face. We had almost reached the edge of the wood
      when a bullet whistled by us. At that the smile passed and a strange look
      came upon him, and he said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This must end here. I think you guess I have no coward&rsquo;s blood; but I am
      sick to the teeth of fightin&rsquo;. I do not wish to shock you, but I swear,
      unless you turn and ride away to the left towards the priest&rsquo;s house, I
      shall save those fellows further trouble by killin&rsquo; myself here; and
      there,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;would be a pleasant place to die&mdash;at the feet of a
      woman who trusted you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew by the look in his eye he would keep his word. &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, is this so?&rsquo; 
      I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is so,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and it shall be done quickly, for the courage to
      death is on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But if I go, you will still try to escape?&rsquo; I said. And he answered that
      he would. Then I spoke a God-bless-you, at which he smiled and shook his
      head, and leanin&rsquo; over, touched my hand, and spoke low: &lsquo;When you see Shon
      McGann, tell him what I did, and say that we are even now. Say also that
      you called Heaven to bless me.&rsquo; Then we swung away from each other, and
      the troopers followed after him, but let me go my way; from which, I
      guessed, they saw I was a woman. And as I rode I heard shots, and turned
      to see; but my horse stumbled on a hole and we fell together, and when I
      waked, I saw that the poor beast&rsquo;s legs were broken. So I ended its
      misery, and made my way as best I could by the stars to your house; but I
      turned sick and fainted at the door, and knew no more until this hour. ...
      You thought me dead, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest bowed his head, and said: &ldquo;These are strange, sad things, my
      child; and they shall seem stranger to you when you hear all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I hear all! Ah, tell me, father, do you know Shon McGann? Can you
      take me to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him, but I do not know where he is. He left the Pipi Valley
      eighteen months ago, and I never saw him afterwards; still I doubt not he
      is somewhere on the plains, and we shall find him&mdash;we shall find him,
      please Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a good lad, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is brave, and he was always kind. He came to me before he left the
      valley&mdash;for he had trouble&mdash;and said to me: &lsquo;Father, I am going
      away, and to what place is far from me to know, but wherever it is, I&rsquo;ll
      live a life that&rsquo;s fit for men, and not like a loafer on God&rsquo;s world;&rsquo; and
      he gave me money for masses to be said&mdash;for the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl put out her hand. &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me think. Masses
      for the dead.... What dead? Not for me; he thought me dead long, long
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not for you,&rdquo; was the slow reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She noticed his hesitation, and said: &ldquo;Speak. I know that there is sorrow
      on him. Someone&mdash;someone&mdash;he loved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone he loved,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she died?&rdquo; The priest bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was his wife&mdash;Shon&rsquo;s wife&rdquo;? and Mary Callen could not hide from
      her words the hurt she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I married her to him, but yet she was not his wife.&rdquo; There was a keen
      distress in the girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Father, tell me, tell me what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, and I will tell you all. He married her, thinking, and she
      thinking, that she was a widowed woman. But her husband came back. A
      terrible thing happened. The woman believing, at a painful time, that he
      who came back was about to take Shon&rsquo;s life, fired at him, and wounded
      him, and then killed herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Callen raised herself upon her elbow, and looked at the priest in
      piteous bewilderment. &ldquo;It is dreadful,&rdquo; she said.... &ldquo;Poor woman!... And
      he had forgotten&mdash;forgotten me. I was dead to him, and am dead to him
      now. There&rsquo;s nothing left but to draw the cold sheet of the grave over me.
      Better for me if I had never come&mdash;if I had never come, and instead
      were lyin&rsquo; by his father and mother beneath the rowan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest took her wrist firmly in his. &ldquo;These are not brave nor
      Christian words, from a brave and Christian girl. But I know that grief
      makes one&rsquo;s words wild. Shon McGann shall be found. In the days when I saw
      him most and best, he talked of you as an angel gone, and he had never
      sought another woman had he known that you lived. The Mounted Police, the
      Riders of the Plains, travel far and wide. But now, there has come from
      the farther West a new detachment to Fort Cypress, and they may be able to
      help us. But listen. There is something more. The man Pretty Pierre, did
      he not speak puzzling words concerning himself and Shon McGann? And did he
      not say to you at the last that they were even now? Well, can you not
      guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Callen&rsquo;s bosom heaved painfully and her eyes stared so at the candle
      in the window that they seemed to grow one with the flame. At last a new
      look crept into them; a thought made the lids close quickly as though it
      burned them. When they opened again they were full of tears that shone in
      the shadow and dropped slowly on her cheeks and flowed on and on,
      quivering too in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest said: &ldquo;You understand, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she answered: &ldquo;I understand. Pierre, the outlaw, was her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Corraine rose and sat beside the table, his book of offices open
      before him. At length he said: &ldquo;There is much that might be spoken; for
      the Church has words for every hour of man&rsquo;s life, whatever it be; but
      there comes to me now a word to say, neither from prayer nor psalm, but
      from the songs of a country where good women are; where however poor the
      fireside, the loves beside it are born of the love of God, though the
      tongue be angry now and then, the foot stumble, and the hand quick at a
      blow.&rdquo; Then, with a soft, ringing voice, he repeated:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;&lsquo;New friends will clasp your hand, dear, new faces on you smile&mdash;
  You&rsquo;ll bide with them and love them, but you&rsquo;ll long for us the while;

  For the word across the water, and the farewell by the stile&mdash;
  For the true heart&rsquo;s here, my darlin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mary Callen&rsquo;s tears flowed afresh at first; but soon after the voice
      ceased she closed her eyes and her sobs stopped, and Father Corraine sat
      down and became lost in thought as he watched the candle. Then there went
      a word among the spirits watching that he was not thinking of the candle,
      or of them that the candle was to light on the way, nor even of this girl
      near him, but of a summer forty years gone when he was a goodly youth,
      with the red on his lip and the light in his eye, and before him, leaning
      on a stile, was a lass with&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;... cheeks like the dawn of day.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And all the good world swam in circles, eddying ever inward until it
      streamed intensely and joyously through her eyes &ldquo;blue as the fairy flax.&rdquo;
       And he had carried the remembrance of this away into the world with him,
      but had never gone back again. He had travelled beyond the seas to live
      among savages and wear out his life in self-denial; and now he had come to
      the evening of his life, a benignant figure in a lonely land. And as he
      sat here murmuring mechanically bits of an office, his heart and mind were
      with a sacred and distant past. Yet the spirits recorded both these things
      on their tablets, as though both were worthy of their remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know that he kept repeating two sentences over and over to
      himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quoniam ipse liberavit me de laqueo venantium et a verbo aspero. Quoniam
      angelis suis mandavit de te: ut custodiant te in omnibus viis tuis.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These he said at first softly to himself, but unconsciously his voice
      became louder, so that the girl heard, and she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Corraine, what are those words? I do not understand them, but they
      sound comforting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he, waking from his dream, changed the Latin into English, and said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunter, and from the
     sharp sword.
   For he hath given his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
     thy ways.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words are good,&rdquo; she said. He then told her he was going out, but
      that he should be within call, saying, at the same time, that someone
      would no doubt arrive from Fort Cypress soon: and he went from the house.
      Then the girl rose slowly, crept lamely to a chair and sat down. Outside,
      the priest paced up and down, stopping now and then, and listening as if
      for horses&rsquo; hoofs. At last he walked some distance away from the house,
      deeply lost in thought, and he did not notice that a man came slowly,
      heavily, to the door of the hut, and opening it, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Callen rose from her seat with a cry in which was timidity, pity, and
      something of horror; for it was Pretty Pierre. She recoiled, but seeing
      how he swayed with weakness, and that his clothes had blood upon them, she
      helped him to a chair. He looked up at her with an enigmatical smile, but
      he did not speak. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you are wounded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded; but still he did not speak. Then his lips moved dryly. She
      brought him water. He drank deeply, and a sigh of relief escaped him. &ldquo;You
      got here safely,&rdquo; he now said. &ldquo;I am glad of that&mdash;though you, too,
      are hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She briefly told him how, and then he said: &ldquo;Well, I suppose you know all
      of me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what happened in Pipi Valley,&rdquo; she said, timidly and wearily.
      &ldquo;Father Corraine told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had answered him, he said: &ldquo;And you are willing to speak with me
      still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saved me,&rdquo; was her brief, convincing reply. &ldquo;How did you escape? Did
      you fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is strange. I did not fight at all. As I said to you, I
      was sick of blood. These men were only doing their duty. I might have
      killed two or three of them, and have escaped, but to what good? When they
      shot my horse, my good Sacrament,&mdash;and put a bullet into this
      shoulder, I crawled away still, and led them a dance, and doubled on them;
      and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful that they have not been here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is wonderful; but be very sure they will be with that candle in
      the window. Why is it there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him. He lifted his brows in stoic irony, and said: &ldquo;Well, we
      shall have an army of them soon.&rdquo; He rose again to his feet. &ldquo;I do not
      wish to die, and I always said that I would never go to prison. Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. She went immediately to the window, took the candle
      from it, and put it behind an improvised shade. No sooner was this done
      than Father Corraine entered the room, and seeing the outlaw, said &ldquo;You
      have come here, Pierre?&rdquo; And his face showed wonder and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, mon pere, for sanctuary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sanctuary! But, my son, if I vex not Heaven by calling you so, why&rdquo;&mdash;he
      saw Pierre stagger slightly. &ldquo;But you are wounded.&rdquo; He put his arm round
      the other&rsquo;s shoulder, and supported him till he recovered himself. Then he
      set to work to bandage anew the wound, from which Pierre himself had not
      unskilfully extracted the bullet. While doing so, the outlaw said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Corraine, I am hunted like a coyote for a crime I did not commit.
      But if I am arrested they will no doubt charge me with other things&mdash;ancient
      things. Well, I have said that I should never be sent to gaol, and I never
      shall; but I do not wish to die at this moment, and I do not wish to
      fight. What is there left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you come here, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his eyes heavily to Mary Callen, and she told Father Corraine
      what had been told her. When she had finished, Pierre added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no coward, as you will witness; but as I said, neither gaol nor
      death do I wish. Well, if they should come here, and you said, Pierre is
      not here, even though I was in the next room, they would believe you, and
      they would not search. Well, I ask such sanctuary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest recoiled and raised his hand in protest. Then, after a moment,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you deserve this? Do you know what you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, oui, I know it is immense, and I deserve nothing: and in return I can
      offer nothing, not even that I will repent. And I have done no good in the
      world; but still perhaps I am worth the saving, as may be seen in the end.
      As for you, well, you will do a little wrong so that the end will be
      right. So?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s eyes looked out long and sadly at the man from under his
      venerable brows, as though he would see through him and beyond him to that
      end; and at last he spoke in a low, firm voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, you have been a bad man; but sometimes you have been generous,
      and of a few good acts I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not good,&rdquo; the other interrupted. &ldquo;I ask this of your charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the law, and my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law! the law!&rdquo; and there was sharp satire in the half-breed&rsquo;s voice.
      &ldquo;What has it done in the West? Think, &lsquo;mon pere!&rsquo; Do you not know a
      hundred cases where the law has dealt foully? There was more justice
      before we had law. Law&mdash;&rdquo; And he named over swiftly, scornfully, a
      score of names and incidents, to which Father Corraine listened intently.
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Pierre, gently, at last, &ldquo;but for your conscience, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;,
      that is greater than law. For you are a good man and a wise man; and you
      know that I shall pay my debts of every kind some sure day. That should
      satisfy your justice, but you are merciful for the moment, and you will
      spare until the time be come, until the corn is ripe in the ear. Why
      should I plead? It is foolish. Still, it is my whim, of which, perhaps, I
      shall be sorry tomorrow... Hark!&rdquo; he added, and then shrugged his
      shoulders and smiled. There were sounds of hoof beats coming faintly to
      them. Father Corraine threw open the door of the other room of the hut,
      and said &ldquo;Go in there&mdash;Pierre. We shall see... we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The outlaw looked at the priest, as if hesitating; but, after, nodded
      meaningly to himself, and entered the room and shut the door. The priest
      stood listening. When the hoof-beats stopped, he opened the door, and went
      out. In the dark he could see that men were dismounting from their horses.
      He stood still and waited. Presently a trooper stepped forward and said
      warmly, yet brusquely, as became his office: &ldquo;Father Corraine, we meet
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s face was overswept by many expressions, in which marvel and
      trouble were uppermost, while joy was in less distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is Shon McGann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shon McGann, and no other.&mdash;I that laughed at the law for many a
      year, though never breaking it beyond repair,&mdash;took your advice,
      Father Corraine, and here I am, holding that law now as my bosom friend at
      the saddle&rsquo;s pommel. Corporal Shon McGann, at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They clasped hands, and the priest said: &ldquo;You have come at my call from
      Fort Cypress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But not these others. They are after a man that&rsquo;s played ducks and
      drakes with the statutes&mdash;Heaven be merciful to him, I say. For
      there&rsquo;s naught I treasure against him; the will of God bein&rsquo; in it all,
      with some doin&rsquo; of the Devil, too, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Pierre, standing with ear to the window of the dark room, heard all
      this, and he pressed his upper lip hard with his forefinger, as if
      something disturbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shon continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t sent after him as all these here know;
      for it&rsquo;s little I&rsquo;d like to clap irons on his wrists, or whistle him to
      come to me with a Winchester or a Navy. So I&rsquo;m here on my business, and
      they&rsquo;re here on theirs. Though we come together it&rsquo;s because we met each
      other hereaway. They&rsquo;ve a thought that, maybe, Pretty Pierre has taken
      refuge with you. They&rsquo;ll little like to disturb you, I know. But with dead
      in your house, and you givin&rsquo; the word of truth, which none other could
      fall from your lips, they&rsquo;ll go on their way to look elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s face was pinched, and there was a wrench at his heart. He
      turned to the others. A trooper stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Corraine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is my duty to search your house; but not a
      foot will I stretch across your threshold if you say no, and give the word
      that the man is not with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corporal McGann,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;the woman whom I thought was dead did
      not die, as you shall see. There is no need for inquiry. But she will go
      with you to Fort Cypress. As for the other, you say that Father Corraine&rsquo;s
      threshold is his own, and at his own command. His home is now a sanctuary&mdash;for
      the afflicted.&rdquo; He went towards the door. As he did so, Mary Callen, who
      had been listening inside the room with shaking frame and bursting heart,
      dropped on her knees beside the table, her head in her arms. The door
      opened. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;a woman who is injured and suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; rejoined the trooper, &ldquo;perhaps it is the woman who was riding with
      the half-breed. We found her dead horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest nodded. Shon McGann looked at the crouching figure by the table
      pityingly. As he looked he was stirred, he knew not why. And she, though
      she did not look, knew that his gaze was on her; and all her will was
      spent in holding her eyes from his face, and from crying out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Pretty Pierre,&rdquo; said the trooper, &ldquo;is not here with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an unfathomable sadness in the priest&rsquo;s eyes, as, with a slight
      motion of the hand towards the room, he said: &ldquo;You see&mdash;he is not
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trooper and his men immediately mounted; but one of them, young Tim
      Kearney, slid from his horse, and came and dropped on his knee in front of
      the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s many a day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since before God or man I bent a knee&mdash;more
      shame to me for that, and for mad days gone; but I care not who knows it,
      I want a word of blessin&rsquo; from the man that&rsquo;s been out here like a saint
      in the wilderness, with a heart like the Son o&rsquo; God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest looked at the man at first as if scarce comprehending this act
      so familiar to him, then he slowly stretched out his hand, said some words
      in benediction, and made the sacred gesture. But his face had a strange
      and absent look, and he held the hand poised, even when the man had risen
      and mounted his horse. One by one the troopers rode through the faint belt
      of light that stretched from the door, and were lost in the darkness, the
      thud of their horses&rsquo; hoofs echoing behind them. But a change had come
      over Corporal Shon McGann. He looked at Father Corraine with concern and
      perplexity. He alone of those who were there had caught the unreal note in
      the proceedings. His eyes were bent on the darkness into which the men had
      gone, and his fingers toyed for an instant with his whistle; but he said a
      hard word of himself under his breath, and turned to meet Father
      Corraine&rsquo;s hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shon McGann,&rdquo; the priest said, &ldquo;I have words to say to you concerning
      this poor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to have her taken to the Fort, I suppose? What was she doing
      with Pretty Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish her taken to her home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is her home, father?&rdquo; And his eyes were cast with trouble on the
      girl, though he could assign no cause for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her home, Shon,&rdquo;&mdash;the priest&rsquo;s voice was very gentle&mdash;&ldquo;her home
      was where they sing such words as these of a wanderer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll hear the wild birds singin&rsquo; beneath a brighter sky,&rsquo; 
   The roof-tree of your home, dear, it will be grand and high;
   But you&rsquo;ll hunger for the hearthstone where a child you used to lie,
   You&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo; back, my darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      During these words Shon&rsquo;s face ran white, then red; and now he stepped
      inside the door like one in a dream, and the girl&rsquo;s face was lifted to his
      as though he had called her. &ldquo;Mary&mdash;Mary Callen!&rdquo; he cried. His arms
      spread out, then dropped to his side, and he fell on his knees by the
      table facing her, and looked at her with love and horror warring in his
      face; for the remembrance that she had been with Pierre was like the hand
      of the grave upon him. Moving not at all, she looked at him, a numb
      despondency in her face. Suddenly Shon&rsquo;s look grew stern, and he was about
      to rise; but Father Corraine put a hand on his shoulder, and said: &ldquo;Stay
      where you are, man&mdash;on your knees. There is your place just now. Be
      not so quick to judge, and remember your own sins before you charge others
      without knowledge. Listen now to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he spoke Mary Callen&rsquo;s tale as he knew it, and as she had given it to
      him, not forgetting to mention that she had been told the thing which had
      occurred in Pipi Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heroic devotion of this woman, and Pretty Pierre&rsquo;s act of friendship
      to her, together with the swift panorama of his past across the seas,
      awoke the whole man in Shon, as the staunch life that he had lately led
      rendered it possible. There was a grave, kind look upon his face when he
      rose at the ending of the tale, and came to her, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, it is I who need forgiveness. Will you come now to the home you
      wanted&rdquo;? and he stretched his arms to her....
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after, as the three sat there, the door of the other room opened,
      and Pretty Pierre came out silently, and was about to pass from the hut;
      but the priest put a hand on his arm, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where do you go, Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre shrugged his shoulder slightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. &lsquo;Mon Dieu!&rsquo;&mdash;that I have put this upon you!&mdash;you
      that never spoke but the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made my sin of no avail,&rdquo; the priest replied; and he motioned
      towards Shon McGann, who was now risen to his feet, Mary clinging to his
      arm. &ldquo;Father Corraine,&rdquo; said Shon, &ldquo;it is my duty to arrest this man; but
      I cannot do it, would not do it, if he came and offered his arms for the
      steel. I&rsquo;ll take the wrong of this now, sir, and such shame as there is in
      that falsehood on my shoulders. And she here and I, and this man too, I
      doubt not, will carry your sin&mdash;as you call it&mdash;to our graves,
      without shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Corraine shook his head sadly, and made no reply, for his soul was
      heavy. He motioned them all to sit down. And they sat there by the light
      of a flickering candle, with the door bolted and a cassock hung across the
      window, lest by any chance this uncommon thing should be seen. But the
      priest remained in a shadowed corner, with a little book in his hand, and
      he was long on his knees. And when morning came they had neither slept nor
      changed the fashion of their watch, save for a moment now and then, when
      Pierre suffered from the pain of his wound, and silently passed up and
      down the little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was half gone when Shon McGann and Mary Callen stood beside
      their horses, ready to mount and go; for Mary had persisted that she could
      travel&mdash;joy makes such marvellous healing. When the moment of parting
      came, Pierre was not there. Mary whispered to her lover concerning this.
      The priest went to the door of the but and called him. He came out slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre,&rdquo; said Shon, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a word to be said between us that had best
      be spoken now, though it&rsquo;s not aisy. It&rsquo;s little you or I will care to
      meet again in this world. There&rsquo;s been credit given and debts paid by both
      of us since the hour when we first met; and it needs thinking to tell
      which is the debtor now, for deeds are hard to reckon; but, before God, I
      believe it&rsquo;s meself;&rdquo; and he turned and looked fondly at Mary Callen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pierre replied: &ldquo;Shon McGann, I make no reckoning close; but we will
      square all accounts here, as you say, and for the last time; for never
      again shall we meet, if it&rsquo;s within my will or doing. But I say I am the
      debtor; and if I pay not here, there will come a time!&rdquo; and he caught his
      shoulder as it shrunk in pain of his wound. He tapped the wound lightly,
      and said with irony: &ldquo;This is my note of hand for my debt, Shon McGann.
      Eh, bien!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he tossed his fingers indolently towards Shon, and turning his eyes
      slowly to Mary Callen, raised his hat in good-bye. She put out her hand
      impulsively to him, but Pierre, shaking his head, looked away. Shon put
      his hand gently on her arm. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, &ldquo;there can be
      no touch of hands between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pierre, looking up, added: &ldquo;C&rsquo;est vrai. That is the truth. You go&mdash;home.
      I got to hide. So&mdash;so.&rdquo; And he turned and went into the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others set their faces northward, and Father Corraine walked beside
      Mary Callen&rsquo;s horse, talking quietly of their future life, and speaking,
      as he would never speak again, of days in that green land of their birth.
      At length, upon a dividing swell of the prairie, he paused to say
      farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times the two turned to see, and he was there, looking after them;
      his forehead bared to the clear inspiring wind, his grey hair blown back,
      his hands clasped. Before descending the trough of a great landwave, they
      turned for the last time, and saw him standing motionless, the one
      solitary being in all their wide horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But outside the line of vision there sat a man in a prairie hut, whose
      eyes travelled over the valley of blue sky stretching away beyond the
      morning, whose face was pale and cold. For hours he sat unmoving, and
      when, at last, someone gently touched him on the shoulder, he only shook
      his head, and went on thinking. He was busy with the grim ledger of his
      life.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
